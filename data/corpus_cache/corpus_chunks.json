[ 1 ] The name comes from Ancient Greek γῆ ( gê ) ' earth ' and λoγία ( -logía ) ' study of, discourse ' . [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Modern geology significantly overlaps all other Earth sciences , including hydrology . It is integrated with Earth system science and planetary science . Geology describes the structure of the Earth on and beneath its surface and the processes that have shaped that structure. Geologists study the mineralogical composition of rocks in order to get insight into their history of formation. Geology determines the relative ages of rocks found at a given location; geochemistry (a branch of geology) determines their absolute ages . [ 4 ] By combining various petrological, crystallographic, and paleontological tools, geologists are able to chronicle the geological history of the Earth as a whole. One aspect is to demonstrate the age of the Earth . Geology provides evidence for plate tectonics , the evolutionary history of life , and the Earth's past climates . Geologists broadly study the properties and processes of Earth and other terrestrial planets. Geologists use a wide variety of methods to understand the Earth's structure and evolution, including fieldwork , rock description , geophysical techniques , chemical analysis , physical experiments , and numerical modelling .

The majority of geological data comes from research on solid Earth materials. Meteorites and other extraterrestrial natural materials are also studied by geological methods. Minerals are naturally occurring elements and compounds with a definite homogeneous chemical composition and an ordered atomic arrangement. Amorphous substances that resemble a mineral are sometimes referred to as mineraloids , although there are exceptions such as georgeite and autunite . Some amorphous substances formed by geological processes are considered minerals if the original substance was a mineral before metamictisation . [ 5 ] Each mineral has distinct physical properties, and there are many tests to determine each of them. Minerals are often identified through these tests. The specimens can be tested for: [ 6 ] A rock is any naturally occurring solid mass or aggregate of minerals or mineraloids . Most research in geology is associated with the study of rocks, as they provide the primary record of the majority of the geological history of the Earth. There are three major types of rock: igneous , sedimentary , and metamorphic . The rock cycle illustrates the relationships among them (see diagram). [ 7 ] When a rock solidifies or crystallizes from melt ( magma or lava ), it is an igneous rock .

[ 8 ] The active flow of molten rock is closely studied in volcanology , and igneous petrology aims to determine the history of igneous rocks from their original molten source to their final crystallization. [ 9 ] Rocks can be weathered and eroded , then redeposited and lithified into a sedimentary rock. Sedimentary rocks are mainly divided into four categories: sandstone, shale, carbonate, and evaporite. This group of classifications focuses partly on the size of sedimentary particles (sandstone and shale), and partly on mineralogy and formation processes (carbonation and evaporation). [ 10 ] Igneous and sedimentary rocks can then be turned into metamorphic rocks by heat and pressure that change its mineral content, resulting in a characteristic fabric . All three types may melt again, and when this happens, new magma is formed, from which an igneous rock may once again solidify. Organic matter, such as coal, bitumen, oil, and natural gas, is linked mainly to organic-rich sedimentary rocks. [ 11 ] To study all three types of rock, geologists evaluate the minerals of which they are composed and their other physical properties, such as texture and fabric . Geologists study unlithified materials (referred to as superficial deposits ) that lie above the bedrock . [ 12 ] This study is often known as Quaternary geology , after the Quaternary period of geologic history, which is the most recent period of geologic time. [ 13 ] In the 1960s, it was discovered that the Earth's lithosphere , which includes the crust and rigid uppermost portion of the upper mantle , is separated into tectonic plates that move across the plastically deforming, solid, upper mantle, which is called the asthenosphere .

This theory is supported by several types of observations, including seafloor spreading [ 15 ] [ 16 ] and the global distribution of mountain terrain and seismicity. [ 17 ] There is an intimate coupling between the movement of the plates on the surface and the convection of the mantle (that is, the heat transfer caused by the slow movement of ductile mantle rock). Thus, oceanic parts of plates and the adjoining mantle convection currents always move in the same direction – because the oceanic lithosphere is actually the rigid upper thermal boundary layer of the convecting mantle. This coupling between rigid plates moving on the surface of the Earth and the convecting mantle is called plate tectonics . [ 18 ] The development of plate tectonics has provided a physical basis for many observations of the solid Earth . Long linear regions of geological features are explained as plate boundaries: [ 19 ] Plate tectonics has provided a mechanism for Alfred Wegener 's theory of continental drift , [ 20 ] in which the continents move across the surface of the Earth over geological time. They provided a driving force for crustal deformation, and a new setting for the observations of structural geology. The power of the theory of plate tectonics lies in its ability to combine all of these observations into a single theory of how the lithosphere moves over the convecting mantle, forming a \"grand unifying theory of geology\".

[ 23 ] Seismologists can use the arrival times of seismic waves to image the interior of the Earth. Early advances in this field showed the existence of a liquid outer core (where shear waves were not able to propagate) and a dense solid inner core . These advances led to the development of a layered model of the Earth, with a lithosphere (including crust) on top, the mantle below (separated within itself by seismic discontinuities at 410 and 660 kilometers), and the outer core and inner core below that. [ 24 ] [ 25 ] Starting in the 1970s, seismologists have been able to use new techniques such as seismic full-waveform inversion to create detailed images of wave speeds inside the earth in the same way a doctor images a body in a CT scan . These images have led to a much more detailed view of the interior of the Earth, and have replaced the simplified layered model with a much more dynamic model.

At the later end of the scale, it is marked by the present day (in the Holocene epoch ). [ 34 ] The following five timelines show the geologic time scale to scale. The first shows the entire time from the formation of Earth to the present, but this gives little space for the most recent eon. The second timeline shows an expanded view of the most recent eon. In a similar way, the most recent era is expanded in the third timeline, the most recent period is expanded in the fourth timeline, and the most recent epoch is expanded in the fifth timeline.

Hence, the Imbrian is named after the formation of the Mare Imbrium basin. The ages of older lunar basins can be dated based on the strength of their intrinsic magnetic field, since the early Moon had a magnetic field that faded over time. The ages of craters can be estimated by morphological and stratigraphic classifications, with younger craters overlapping older impacts and generally showing less impact wear. [ 39 ] Epochs: Methods for relative dating were developed when geology first emerged as a natural science . Geologists still use the following principles today as a means to provide information about geological history and the timing of geological events. [ 40 ] The principle of uniformitarianism states that the geological processes observed in operation that modify the Earth's crust at present have worked in much the same way over geological time. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] A fundamental principle of geology advanced by the 18th-century Scottish physician and geologist James Hutton is that \"the present is the key to the past.\" In Hutton's words: \"the past history of our globe must be explained by what can be seen to be happening now.\" [ 43 ] The principle of intrusive relationships concerns crosscutting intrusions. In geology, when an igneous intrusion cuts across a formation of sedimentary rock , it can be determined that the igneous intrusion is younger than the sedimentary rock.

[ 45 ] The principle of cross-cutting relationships pertains to the formation of faults and the age of the sequences through which they cut. Faults are younger than the rocks they cut; accordingly, if a fault is found that penetrates some formations but not those on top of it, then the formations that were cut are older than the fault, and the ones that are not cut must be younger than the fault. [ 42 ] Finding the key bed in these situations may help determine whether the fault is a normal fault or a thrust fault . [ 46 ] The principle of inclusions and components states that, with sedimentary rocks, if inclusions (or clasts ) are found in a formation, then the inclusions must be older than the formation that contains them. [ 42 ] For example, in sedimentary rocks, it is common for gravel from an older formation to be ripped up and included in a newer layer. A similar situation with igneous rocks occurs when xenoliths are found. These foreign bodies are picked up as magma or lava flows, and are incorporated, later to cool in the matrix. As a result, xenoliths are older than the rock that contains them. [ 47 ] The principle of original horizontality states that the deposition of sediments occurs as essentially horizontal beds. [ 42 ] Observation of modern marine and non-marine sediments in a wide variety of environments supports this generalization (although cross-bedding is inclined, the overall orientation of cross-bedded units is horizontal).

[ 46 ] The principle of superposition states that a sedimentary rock layer in a tectonically undisturbed sequence is younger than the one beneath it and older than the one above it. Logically a younger layer cannot slip beneath a layer previously deposited. [ 42 ] This principle allows sedimentary layers to be viewed as a form of the vertical timeline, a partial or complete record of the time elapsed from deposition of the lowest layer to deposition of the highest bed. [ 46 ] The principle of faunal succession is based on the appearance of fossils in sedimentary rocks. As organisms exist during the same period throughout the world, their presence or (sometimes) absence provides a relative age of the formations where they appear. [ 42 ] Based on principles that William Smith laid out almost a hundred years before the publication of Charles Darwin 's theory of evolution , the principles of succession developed independently of evolutionary thought. The principle becomes quite complex, however, given the uncertainties of fossilization, localization of fossil types due to lateral changes in habitat ( facies change in sedimentary strata), and that not all fossils formed globally at the same time. [ 48 ] Geologists use methods to determine the absolute age of rock samples and geological events. These may be used in conjunction with relative dating methods or to calibrate relative methods.

This changed the understanding of geological time. Previously, geologists could only use fossils and stratigraphic correlation to date sections of rock relative to one another. With isotopic dates, it became possible to assign absolute ages to rock units, and these absolute dates could be applied to fossil sequences in which there was datable material, converting the old relative ages into new absolute ages. [ 51 ] For many geological applications, isotope ratios of radioactive elements are measured in minerals that give the amount of time that has passed since a rock passed through its particular closure temperature : the point at which different radiometric isotopes stop diffusing into and out of the crystal lattice . [ 52 ] [ 53 ] These are used in geochronologic and thermochronologic studies. The most suitable isotope systems for this purpose include uranium–lead , rubidium–strontium , and potassium–argon . [ 54 ] Uranium–thorium dating is used for dating calcium-carbonate. [ 55 ] Dating of lava and volcanic ash layers found within a stratigraphic sequence can provide absolute age data for sedimentary rock units that do not contain radioactive isotopes and calibrate relative dating techniques.

[ relevant? ] The geology of an area changes through time as rock units are deposited and inserted, and deformational processes alter their shapes and locations. Rock units are first emplaced either by deposition onto the surface or intrusion into the overlying rock . Deposition can occur when sediments settle onto the surface of the Earth and later lithify into sedimentary rock, [ 61 ] or when as volcanic material such as volcanic ash [ 62 ] or lava flows blanket the surface. Igneous intrusions such as batholiths , laccoliths , dikes , and sills , push upwards into the overlying rock, and crystallize as they intrude. [ 45 ] After the initial sequence of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be deformed and/or metamorphosed . Deformation typically occurs as a result of horizontal shortening, horizontal extension , or side-to-side ( strike-slip ) motion. These structural regimes broadly relate to convergent boundaries , divergent boundaries , and transform boundaries, respectively, between tectonic plates.

Because rock units, other than muds, do not significantly change in volume , this is accomplished in two primary ways: through faulting and folding . In the shallow crust, where brittle deformation can occur, thrust faults form, which causes the deeper rock to move on top of the shallower rock. [ 64 ] Because deeper rock is often older, as noted by the principle of superposition , this can result in older rocks moving on top of younger ones. [ 65 ] Movement along faults can result in folding, either because the faults are not planar or because rock layers are dragged along, forming drag folds as slip occurs along the fault. [ 63 ] : 57–58 Deeper in the Earth, rocks behave plastically and fold instead of faulting. These folds can either be those where the material in the center of the fold buckles upwards, creating \" antiforms \", or where it buckles downwards, creating \" synforms \". If the tops of the rock units within the folds remain pointing upwards, they are called anticlines and synclines , respectively. If some of the units in the fold are facing downward, the structure is called an overturned anticline or syncline, and if all of the rock units are overturned or the correct up-direction is unknown, they are simply called by the most general terms, antiforms, and synforms.

This can remove signs of the original textures of the rocks, such as bedding in sedimentary rocks, flow features of lavas , and crystal patterns in crystalline rocks . [ 67 ] Extension causes the rock units as a whole to become longer and thinner. This is primarily accomplished through normal faulting and through the ductile stretching and thinning. Normal faults drop rock units that are higher below those that are lower. This typically results in younger units ending up below older units. Stretching of units can result in their thinning. [ 68 ] In fact, at one location within the Maria Fold and Thrust Belt , the entire sedimentary sequence of the Grand Canyon appears over a length of less than a meter. [ citation needed ] Rocks at the depth to be ductilely stretched are often metamorphosed. These stretched rocks can pinch into lenses, known as boudins , after the French word for \"sausage\" because of their visual similarity. Where rock units slide past one another, strike-slip faults develop in shallow regions, and become shear zones at deeper depths where the rocks deform ductilely. The addition of new rock units, both depositionally and intrusively, often occurs during deformation.

He pinned small thorns into starfish larvae and noticed unusual cells surrounding the thorns. This was the active response of the body trying to maintain its integrity.

The important lymphoid organs of the immune system are the thymus , [ 11 ] bone marrow , and chief lymphatic tissues such as spleen , tonsils , lymph vessels , lymph nodes , adenoids , and liver . However, many components of the immune system are cellular in nature, and not associated with specific organs, but rather embedded or circulating in various tissues located throughout the body. Classical immunology ties in with the fields of epidemiology and medicine . It studies the relationship between the body systems, pathogens , and immunity. The earliest written mention of immunity can be traced back to the plague of Athens in 430 BCE. Thucydides noted that people who had recovered from a previous bout of the disease could nurse the sick without contracting the illness a second time. [ 12 ] Many other ancient societies have references to this phenomenon, but it was not until the 19th and 20th centuries before the concept developed into scientific theory. The study of the molecular and cellular components that comprise the immune system, including their function and interaction, is the central science of immunology. The immune system has been divided into a more primitive innate immune system and, in vertebrates , an acquired or adaptive immune system .

Antibodies are proteins that neutralize the disease-causing microorganisms. Antibodies do not directly kill pathogens, but instead, identify antigens as targets for destruction by other immune cells such as phagocytes or NK cells. The (antibody) response is defined as the interaction between antibodies and antigens . [ 14 ] Antibodies are specific proteins released from a certain class of immune cells known as B lymphocytes , while antigens are defined as anything that elicits the generation of antibodies ( anti body gen erators). Immunology rests on an understanding of the properties of these two biological entities and the cellular response to both. It is now getting clear that the immune responses contribute to the development of many common disorders not traditionally viewed as immunologic, [ 15 ] including metabolic, cardiovascular, cancer, and neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's disease. Besides, there are direct implications of the immune system in the infectious diseases (tuberculosis, malaria, hepatitis, pneumonia, dysentery, and helminth infestations) as well.

Immunotherapy is most commonly used to treat allergies, autoimmune disorders such as Crohn's disease , Hashimoto's thyroiditis and rheumatoid arthritis , and certain cancers . Immunotherapy is also often used for patients who are immunosuppressed (such as those with HIV ) and people with other immune deficiencies.

It also involves diseases of other systems, where immune reactions play a part in the pathology and clinical features. The diseases caused by disorders of the immune system fall into two broad categories: Other immune system disorders include various hypersensitivities (such as in asthma and other allergies ) that respond inappropriately to otherwise harmless compounds . The most well-known disease that affects the immune system itself is AIDS , an immunodeficiency characterized by the suppression of CD4+ (\"helper\") T cells , dendritic cells and macrophages by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

[ 17 ] Clinical immunology and allergy is usually a subspecialty of internal medicine or pediatrics . Fellows in Clinical Immunology are typically exposed to many of the different aspects of the specialty and treat allergic conditions, primary immunodeficiencies and systemic autoimmune and autoinflammatory conditions. As part of their training fellows may do additional rotations in rheumatology , pulmonology , otorhinolaryngology , dermatology and the immunologic lab. [ 18 ] When health conditions worsen to emergency status, portions of immune system organs, including the thymus, spleen, bone marrow, lymph nodes, and other lymphatic tissues, can be surgically excised for examination while patients are still alive. Immunology is strongly experimental in everyday practice but is also characterized by an ongoing theoretical attitude. Many theories have been suggested in immunology from the end of the nineteenth century up to the present time. The end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century saw a battle between \"cellular\" and \"humoral\" theories of immunity. According to the cellular theory of immunity, represented in particular by Elie Metchnikoff , it was cells – more precisely, phagocytes – that were responsible for immune responses. In contrast, the humoral theory of immunity, held by Robert Koch [ 19 ] and Emil von Behring , [ 20 ] among others, stated that the active immune agents were soluble components (molecules) found in the organism's \"humors\" rather than its cells.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] In the mid-1950s, Macfarlane Burnet , inspired by a suggestion made by Niels Jerne , [ 24 ] formulated the clonal selection theory (CST) of immunity. [ 25 ] On the basis of CST, Burnet developed a theory of how an immune response is triggered according to the self/nonself distinction: \"self\" constituents (constituents of the body) do not trigger destructive immune responses, while \"nonself\" entities (e.g., pathogens, an allograft) trigger a destructive immune response. [ 26 ] The theory was later modified to reflect new discoveries regarding histocompatibility or the complex \"two-signal\" activation of T cells. [ 27 ] The self/nonself theory of immunity and the self/nonself vocabulary have been criticized, [ 23 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] but remain very influential. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] More recently, several theoretical frameworks have been suggested in immunology, including \" autopoietic \" views, [ 32 ] \"cognitive immune\" views, [ 33 ] the \" danger model \" (or \"danger theory\"), [ 28 ] and the \"discontinuity\" theory.

Once born, a child's immune system responds favorably to protein antigens while not as well to glycoproteins and polysaccharides . In fact, many of the infections acquired by neonates are caused by low virulence organisms like Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas . In neonates, opsonic activity and the ability to activate the complement cascade is very limited. For example, the mean level of C3 in a newborn is approximately 65% of that found in the adult. Phagocytic activity is also greatly impaired in newborns. This is due to lower opsonic activity, as well as diminished up-regulation of integrin and selectin receptors, which limit the ability of neutrophils to interact with adhesion molecules in the endothelium . Their monocytes are slow and have a reduced ATP production, which also limits the newborn's phagocytic activity. Although, the number of total lymphocytes is significantly higher than in adults, the cellular and humoral immunity is also impaired. Antigen-presenting cells in newborns have a reduced capability to activate T cells. Also, T cells of a newborn proliferate poorly and produce very small amounts of cytokines like IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-12, and IFN-g which limits their capacity to activate the humoral response as well as the phagocitic activity of macrophage.

At birth, most of the immunoglobulin present is maternal IgG. These antibodies are transferred from the placenta to the fetus using the FcRn (neonatal Fc receptor). [ 42 ] Because IgM, IgD, IgE and IgA do not cross the placenta, they are almost undetectable at birth. Some IgA is provided by breast milk . These passively-acquired antibodies can protect the newborn for up to 18 months, but their response is usually short-lived and of low affinity . [ 41 ] These antibodies can also produce a negative response. If a child is exposed to the antibody for a particular antigen before being exposed to the antigen itself then the child will produce a dampened response. Passively acquired maternal antibodies can suppress the antibody response to active immunization. Similarly, the response of T-cells to vaccination differs in children compared to adults, and vaccines that induce Th1 responses in adults do not readily elicit these same responses in neonates. [ 41 ] Between six and nine months after birth, a child's immune system begins to respond more strongly to glycoproteins , but there is usually no marked improvement in their response to polysaccharides until they are at least one year old. This can be the reason for distinct time frames found in vaccination schedules .

[ 45 ] There is evidence that these steroids not only act directly on the primary and secondary sexual characteristics but also have an effect on the development and regulation of the immune system, [ 46 ] including an increased risk in developing pubescent and post-pubescent autoimmunity. [ 47 ] There is also some evidence that cell surface receptors on B cells and macrophages may detect sex hormones in the system. [ 48 ] The female sex hormone 17-β-estradiol has been shown to regulate the level of immunological response, [ 49 ] while some male androgens such as testosterone seem to suppress the stress response to infection. Other androgens, however, such as DHEA , increase immune response. [ 50 ] As in females, the male sex hormones seem to have more control of the immune system during puberty and post-puberty than during the rest of a male's adult life. Physical changes during puberty such as thymic involution also affect immunological response. [ 51 ] Ecoimmunology, or ecological immunology, explores the relationship between the immune system of an organism and its social, biotic and abiotic environment.

[ 52 ] Behavioural immunity, a phrase coined by Mark Schaller , specifically refers to psychological pathogen avoidance drivers, such as disgust aroused by stimuli encountered around pathogen-infected individuals, such as the smell of vomit . [ 53 ] More broadly, \"behavioural\" ecological immunity has been demonstrated in multiple species. For example, the Monarch butterfly often lays its eggs on certain toxic milkweed species when infected with parasites. These toxins reduce parasite growth in the offspring of the infected Monarch. However, when uninfected Monarch butterflies are forced to feed only on these toxic plants, they suffer a fitness cost as reduced lifespan relative to other uninfected Monarch butterflies. [ 54 ] This indicates that laying eggs on toxic plants is a costly behaviour in Monarchs which has probably evolved to reduce the severity of parasite infection. [ 52 ] Symbiont-mediated defenses are also heritable across host generations, despite a non-genetic direct basis for the transmission. Aphids , for example, rely on several different symbionts for defense from key parasites, and can vertically transmit their symbionts from parent to offspring. [ 55 ] Therefore, a symbiont that successfully confers protection from a parasite is more likely to be passed to the host offspring, allowing coevolution with parasites attacking the host in a way similar to traditional immunity. The preserved immune tissues of extinct species, such as the thylacine ( Thylacine cynocephalus ), can also provide insights into their biology.

In Egypt , from the late Middle Kingdom onwards, the brain was regularly removed in preparation for mummification . It was believed at the time that the heart was the seat of intelligence. According to Herodotus , the first step of mummification was to \"take a crooked piece of iron, and with it draw out the brain through the nostrils, thus getting rid of a portion, while the skull is cleared of the rest by rinsing with drugs.\" [ 11 ] The view that the heart was the source of consciousness was not challenged until the time of the Greek physician Hippocrates . He believed that the brain was not only involved with sensation—since most specialized organs (e.g., eyes, ears, tongue) are located in the head near the brain—but was also the seat of intelligence. [ 12 ] Plato also speculated that the brain was the seat of the rational part of the soul. [ 13 ] Aristotle , however, believed the heart was the center of intelligence and that the brain regulated the amount of heat from the heart.

Luigi Galvani 's pioneering work in the late 1700s set the stage for studying the electrical excitability of muscles and neurons. In 1843 Emil du Bois-Reymond demonstrated the electrical nature of the nerve signal, [ 16 ] whose speed Hermann von Helmholtz proceeded to measure, [ 17 ] and in 1875 Richard Caton found electrical phenomena in the cerebral hemispheres of rabbits and monkeys. [ 18 ] Adolf Beck published in 1890 similar observations of spontaneous electrical activity of the brain of rabbits and dogs. [ 19 ] Studies of the brain became more sophisticated after the invention of the microscope and the development of a staining procedure by Camillo Golgi during the late 1890s. The procedure used a silver chromate salt to reveal the intricate structures of individual neurons . His technique was used by Santiago Ramón y Cajal and led to the formation of the neuron doctrine , the hypothesis that the functional unit of the brain is the neuron. [ 20 ] Golgi and Ramón y Cajal shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1906 for their extensive observations, descriptions, and categorizations of neurons throughout the brain.

[ 22 ] [ 23 ] The localization of function hypothesis was supported by observations of epileptic patients conducted by John Hughlings Jackson , who correctly inferred the organization of the motor cortex by watching the progression of seizures through the body. Carl Wernicke further developed the theory of the specialization of specific brain structures in language comprehension and production. In 1894, neurologist and psychiatrist Edward Flatau published a human brain atlas “Atlas of the Human Brain and the Course of the Nerve-Fibres” which consisted of long-exposure photographs of fresh brain sections.

During the same period, Schmitt established a neuroscience research program within the Biology Department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , bringing together biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics.

In 1981 Catherine Morris and Harold Lecar combined these models in the Morris–Lecar model .

This has allowed neuroscientists to study the nervous system in all its aspects: how it is structured, how it works, how it develops, how it malfunctions, and how it can be changed. For example, it has become possible to understand, in much detail, the complex processes occurring within a single neuron . Neurons are cells specialized for communication. They are able to communicate with neurons and other cell types through specialized junctions called synapses , at which electrical or electrochemical signals can be transmitted from one cell to another. Many neurons extrude a long thin filament of axoplasm called an axon , which may extend to distant parts of the body and are capable of rapidly carrying electrical signals, influencing the activity of other neurons, muscles, or glands at their termination points. A nervous system emerges from the assemblage of neurons that are connected to each other in neural circuits , and networks . The vertebrate nervous system can be split into two parts: the central nervous system (defined as the brain and spinal cord ), and the peripheral nervous system .

At least one out of three of the approximately 20,000 genes belonging to the human genome is expressed mainly in the brain.

At this level, tools from molecular biology and genetics are used to understand how neurons develop and how genetic changes affect biological functions.

[ 55 ] Systems neuroscience research centers on the structural and functional architecture of the developing human brain, and the functions of large-scale brain networks , or functionally-connected systems within the brain. Alongside brain development, systems neuroscience also focuses on how the structure and function of the brain enables or restricts the processing of sensory information, using learned mental models of the world, to motivate behavior. Questions in systems neuroscience include how neural circuits are formed and used anatomically and physiologically to produce functions such as reflexes , multisensory integration , motor coordination , circadian rhythms , emotional responses , learning , and memory . [ 56 ] In other words, this area of research studies how connections are made and morphed in the brain, and the effect it has on human sensation, movement, attention, inhibitory control, decision-making, reasoning, memory formation, reward, and emotion regulation.

[ 58 ] The related fields of neuroethology and neuropsychology address the question of how neural substrates underlie specific animal and human behaviors. [ 59 ] Neuroendocrinology and psychoneuroimmunology examine interactions between the nervous system and the endocrine and immune systems, respectively. [ 60 ] Despite many advancements, the way that networks of neurons perform complex cognitive processes and behaviors is still poorly understood. [ 61 ] Cognitive neuroscience addresses the questions of how psychological functions are produced by neural circuitry . The emergence of powerful new measurement techniques such as neuroimaging (e.g., fMRI , PET , SPECT ), EEG , MEG , electrophysiology , optogenetics and human genetic analysis combined with sophisticated experimental techniques from cognitive psychology allows neuroscientists and psychologists to address abstract questions such as how cognition and emotion are mapped to specific neural substrates. Although many studies hold a reductionist stance looking for the neurobiological basis of cognitive phenomena, recent research shows that there is an interplay between neuroscientific findings and conceptual research, soliciting and integrating both perspectives. For example, neuroscience research on empathy solicited an interdisciplinary debate involving philosophy, psychology and psychopathology.

A study into consumer responses for example uses EEG to investigate neural correlates associated with narrative transportation into stories about energy efficiency . [ 64 ] Questions in computational neuroscience can span a wide range of levels of traditional analysis, such as development , structure , and cognitive functions of the brain. Research in this field utilizes mathematical models , theoretical analysis, and computer simulation to describe and verify biologically plausible neurons and nervous systems. For example, biological neuron models are mathematical descriptions of spiking neurons which can be used to describe both the behavior of single neurons as well as the dynamics of neural networks .

Along with climatology , atmospheric physics , atmospheric chemistry , and aeronomy , meteorology forms the broader field of the atmospheric sciences . The interactions between Earth's atmosphere and its oceans (notably El Niño and La Niña ) are studied in the interdisciplinary field of hydrometeorology . Other interdisciplinary areas include biometeorology , space weather , and planetary meteorology. Marine weather forecasting relates meteorology to maritime and coastal safety, based on atmospheric interactions with large bodies of water. Meteorologists study meteorological phenomena driven by solar radiation , Earth's rotation , ocean currents , and other factors. These include everyday weather like clouds , precipitation , and wind patterns, as well as severe weather events such as tropical cyclones and severe winter storms . Such phenomena are quantified using variables like temperature , pressure , and humidity , which are then used to forecast weather at local ( microscale ), regional ( mesoscale and synoptic scale ), and global scales . Meteorologists collect data using basic instruments like thermometers , barometers , and weather vanes (for surface-level measurements), alongside advanced tools like weather satellites , balloons , reconnaissance aircraft, buoys , and radars .

It is adopting innovations like machine learning , ensemble forecasting , and high-resolution global climate modeling.

However, as meteorological instruments did not exist, the inquiry was largely qualitative, and could only be judged by more general theoretical speculations.

He observed that air temperature decreased with increasing height and that clouds contain moisture. He also noted that heat caused objects to rise, and therefore the heat on a summer day would drive clouds to an altitude where the moisture would freeze. [ 7 ] : 6 Empedocles theorized on the change of the seasons. He believed that fire and water opposed each other in the atmosphere, and when fire gained the upper hand, the result was summer, and when water did, it was winter. Democritus also wrote about the flooding of the Nile. He said that snow in northern parts of the world melted during the summer solstice. This would cause vapors to form clouds, which would cause storms when driven to the Nile by northerly winds, thus filling the lakes and the Nile.

They are all called 'swooping bolts', because they swoop down upon the earth. Lightning is sometimes smoky, and is then called 'smouldering lightning'; sometimes it darts quickly along, and is then said to be 'vivid'; at other times it travels in crooked lines, and is called 'forked lightning'; when it swoops down upon some object it is called 'swooping lightning'. After Aristotle, progress in meteorology stalled for a long time. Theophrastus compiled a book on weather forecasting, called the Book of Signs , as well as On Winds . He gave hundreds of signs for weather phenomena for a period up to a year. [ 7 ] : 25 His system was based on dividing the year by the setting and the rising of the Pleiad, halves into solstices and equinoxes, and the continuity of the weather for those periods.

Rules based on actions of animals are also present in his work, like that if a dog rolls on the ground, it is a sign of a storm. Shooting stars and the Moon were also considered significant. However, he made no attempt to explain these phenomena, referring only to the Aristotelian method.

He closely followed Aristotle's theories. By the end of the second century BC, the center of science shifted from Athens to Alexandria , home to the ancient Library of Alexandria . In the 2nd century AD, Ptolemy 's Almagest dealt with meteorology, because it was considered a subset of astronomy. He gave several astrological weather predictions.

[ 7 ] : 37 In the appendix Les Meteores , he applied these principles to meteorology. He discussed terrestrial bodies and vapors which arise from them, proceeding to explain the formation of clouds from drops of water, and winds, clouds then dissolving into rain, hail and snow. He also discussed the effects of light on the rainbow. Descartes hypothesized that all bodies were composed of small particles of different shapes and interwovenness. All of his theories were based on this hypothesis. He explained the rain as caused by clouds becoming too large for the air to hold, and that clouds became snow if the air was not warm enough to melt them, or hail if they met colder wind. Like his predecessors, Descartes's method was deductive, as meteorological instruments were not developed and extensively used yet. He introduced the Cartesian coordinate system to meteorology and stressed the importance of mathematics in natural science. His work established meteorology as a legitimate branch of physics.

    "text": "Machine learning ( ML ) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions . [ 1 ] Within a subdiscipline in machine learning, advances in the field of deep learning have allowed neural networks , a class of statistical algorithms, to surpass many previous machine learning approaches in performance. ML finds application in many fields, including natural language processing , computer vision , speech recognition , email filtering , agriculture , and medicine . The application of ML to business problems is known as predictive analytics . Statistics and mathematical optimisation (mathematical programming) methods compose the foundations of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) through unsupervised learning . [ 3 ] [ 4 ] From a theoretical viewpoint, probably approximately correct learning provides a mathematical and statistical framework for describing machine learning. Most traditional machine learning and deep learning algorithms can be described as empirical risk minimisation under this framework. The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel , an IBM employee and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence . [ 5 ] [ 6 ] The synonym self-teaching computers was also used during this time period. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] The earliest machine learning program was introduced in the 1950s when Arthur Samuel invented a computer program that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side, but the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes.

[ 9 ] In 1949, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb published the book The Organization of Behavior , in which he introduced a theoretical neural structure formed by certain interactions among nerve cells . [ 10 ] Hebb's model of neurons interacting with one another set a groundwork for how AIs and machine learning algorithms work under nodes, or artificial neurons used by computers to communicate data. [ 9 ] Other researchers who have studied human cognitive systems contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well, including logician Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch , who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up with algorithms that mirror human thought processes. [ 9 ] By the early 1960s, an experimental \"learning machine\" with punched tape memory, called Cybertron, had been developed by Raytheon Company to analyse sonar signals, electrocardiograms , and speech patterns using rudimentary reinforcement learning . It was repetitively \"trained\" by a human operator/teacher to recognise patterns and equipped with a \" goof \" button to cause it to reevaluate incorrect decisions. [ 11 ] A representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was Nils Nilsson 's book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification. [ 12 ] Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973.

[ 14 ] Tom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T , as measured by P , improves with experience E .\" [ 15 ] This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows Alan Turing 's proposal in his paper \" Computing Machinery and Intelligence \", in which the question, \"Can machines think?\", is replaced with the question, \"Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?\". [ 16 ] Modern-day Machine Learning algorithms are broken into 3 algorithm types: Supervised Learning Algorithms, Unsupervised Learning Algorithms, and Reinforcement Learning Algorithms. [ 17 ] In 2014 Ian Goodfellow and others introduced generative adversarial networks (GANs) with realistic data synthesis. [ 18 ] By 2016 AlphaGo obtained victory against top human players using reinforcement learning techniques.

[ 21 ] Probabilistic reasoning was also employed, especially in automated medical diagnosis . [ 22 ] : 488 However, an increasing emphasis on the logical, knowledge-based approach caused a rift between AI and machine learning. Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation. [ 22 ] : 488 By 1980, expert systems had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favour. [ 23 ] Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to inductive logic programming (ILP), but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in pattern recognition and information retrieval . [ 22 ] : 708–710, 755 Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and computer science around the same time. This line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS field, as \" connectionism \", by researchers from other disciplines, including John Hopfield , David Rumelhart , and Geoffrey Hinton . Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation . [ 22 ] : 25 Machine learning (ML), reorganised and recognised as its own field, started to flourish in the 1990s.

[ 23 ] There is a close connection between machine learning and compression. A system that predicts the posterior probabilities of a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression (by using arithmetic coding on the output distribution). Conversely, an optimal compressor can be used for prediction (by finding the symbol that compresses best, given the previous history). This equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for \"general intelligence\". [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] An alternative view can show compression algorithms implicitly map strings into implicit feature space vectors , and compression-based similarity measures compute similarity within these feature spaces. For each compressor C(.) we define an associated vector space ℵ, such that C(.) maps an input string x, corresponding to the vector norm ||~x||. An exhaustive examination of the feature spaces underlying all compression algorithms is precluded by space; instead, feature vectors chooses to examine three representative lossless compression methods, LZW, LZ77, and PPM. [ 27 ] According to AIXI theory, a connection more directly explained in Hutter Prize , the best possible compression of x is the smallest possible software that generates x. For example, in that model, a zip file's compressed size includes both the zip file and the unzipping software, since you can not unzip it without both, but there may be an even smaller combined form.

[ 29 ] In unsupervised machine learning , k-means clustering can be utilized to compress data by grouping similar data points into clusters. This technique simplifies handling extensive datasets that lack predefined labels and finds widespread use in fields such as image compression . [ 30 ] Data compression aims to reduce the size of data files, enhancing storage efficiency and speeding up data transmission. K-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, is employed to partition a dataset into a specified number of clusters, k, each represented by the centroid of its points. This process condenses extensive datasets into a more compact set of representative points. Particularly beneficial in image and signal processing , k-means clustering aids in data reduction by replacing groups of data points with their centroids, thereby preserving the core information of the original data while significantly decreasing the required storage space. [ 31 ] Large language models (LLMs) are also efficient lossless data compressors on some data sets, as demonstrated by DeepMind 's research with the Chinchilla 70B model. Developed by DeepMind, Chinchilla 70B effectively compressed data, outperforming conventional methods such as Portable Network Graphics (PNG) for images and Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) for audio.

There is, however, some reason to be concerned that the data set used for testing overlaps the LLM training data set, making it possible that the Chinchilla 70B model is only an efficient compression tool on data it has already been trained on. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] Machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on known properties learned from the training data, data mining focuses on the discovery of (previously) unknown properties in the data (this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases). Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as \" unsupervised learning \" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, ECML PKDD being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data.

[ citation needed ] Machine learning also has intimate ties to optimisation : Many learning problems are formulated as minimisation of some loss function on a training set of examples. Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the preassigned labels of a set of examples). [ 34 ] Characterizing the generalisation of various learning algorithms is an active topic of current research, especially for deep learning algorithms. Machine learning and statistics are closely related fields in terms of methods, but distinct in their principal goal: statistics draws population inferences from a sample , while machine learning finds generalisable predictive patterns. [ 35 ] Conventional statistical analyses require the a priori selection of a model most suitable for the study data set. In addition, only significant or theoretically relevant variables based on previous experience are included for analysis. In contrast, machine learning is not built on a pre-structured model; rather, the data shape the model by detecting underlying patterns. The more variables (input) used to train the model, the more accurate the ultimate model will be. [ 36 ] Leo Breiman distinguished two statistical modelling paradigms: data model and algorithmic model, [ 37 ] wherein \"algorithmic model\" means more or less the machine learning algorithms like Random Forest .

[ 39 ] Statistical physics is thus finding applications in the area of medical diagnostics . [ 40 ] A core objective of a learner is to generalise from its experience. [ 2 ] [ 41 ] Generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set. The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases. The computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory via the probably approximately correct learning model. Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms. Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common. The bias–variance decomposition is one way to quantify generalisation error . For the best performance in the context of generalisation, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data. If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has underfitted the data. If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. But if the"

But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to overfitting and generalisation will be poorer. [ 42 ] In addition to performance bounds, learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning. In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time . There are two kinds of time complexity results: Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time. Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time. Machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, which correspond to learning paradigms, depending on the nature of the \"signal\" or \"feedback\" available to the learning system: Although each algorithm has advantages and limitations, no single algorithm works for all problems. [ 43 ] [ 44 ] [ 45 ] Supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs. [ 46 ] The data, known as training data , consists of a set of training examples. Each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output, also known as a supervisory signal. In the mathematical model, each training example is represented by an array or vector, sometimes called a feature vector , and the training data is represented by a matrix .

[ 47 ] An optimal function allows the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data. An algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task. [ 15 ] Types of supervised-learning algorithms include active learning , classification and regression . [ 48 ] Classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values, while regression algorithms are used when the outputs can take any numerical value within a range. For example, in a classification algorithm that filters emails, the input is an incoming email, and the output is the folder in which to file the email. In contrast, regression is used for tasks such as predicting a person's height based on factors like age and genetics or forecasting future temperatures based on historical data. [ 49 ] Similarity learning is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification, but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are. It has applications in ranking , recommendation systems , visual identity tracking, face verification, and speaker verification.

Central applications of unsupervised machine learning include clustering, dimensionality reduction , [ 4 ] and density estimation . [ 50 ] Cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called clusters ) so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria, while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar. Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated, for example, by internal compactness , or the similarity between members of the same cluster, and separation , the difference between clusters. Other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity . A special type of unsupervised learning called, self-supervised learning involves training a model by generating the supervisory signal from the data itself. [ 51 ] [ 52 ] Dimensionality reduction is a process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables. [ 53 ] In other words, it is a process of reducing the dimension of the feature set, also called the \"number of features\". Most of the dimensionality reduction techniques can be considered as either feature elimination or extraction . One of the popular methods of dimensionality reduction is principal component analysis (PCA). PCA involves changing higher-dimensional data (e.g., 3D) to a smaller space (e.g., 2D).

[ 7 ] Fundamentally, deep learning refers to a class of machine learning algorithms in which a hierarchy of layers is used to transform input data into a progressively more abstract and composite representation. For example, in an image recognition model, the raw input may be an image (represented as a tensor of pixels ). The first representational layer may attempt to identify basic shapes such as lines and circles, the second layer may compose and encode arrangements of edges, the third layer may encode a nose and eyes, and the fourth layer may recognize that the image contains a face. Importantly, a deep learning process can learn which features to optimally place at which level on its own . Prior to deep learning, machine learning techniques often involved hand-crafted feature engineering to transform the data into a more suitable representation for a classification algorithm to operate on. In the deep learning approach, features are not hand-crafted and the model discovers useful feature representations from the data automatically. This does not eliminate the need for hand-tuning; for example, varying numbers of layers and layer sizes can provide different degrees of abstraction. [ 8 ] [ 2 ] The word \"deep\" in \"deep learning\" refers to the number of layers through which the data is transformed. More precisely, deep learning systems have a substantial credit assignment path (CAP) depth. The CAP is the chain of transformations from input to output.

For a feedforward neural network , the depth of the CAPs is that of the network and is the number of hidden layers plus one (as the output layer is also parameterized). For recurrent neural networks , in which a signal may propagate through a layer more than once, the CAP depth is potentially unlimited. [ 9 ] No universally agreed-upon threshold of depth divides shallow learning from deep learning, but most researchers agree that deep learning involves CAP depth higher than two. CAP of depth two has been shown to be a universal approximator in the sense that it can emulate any function. [ 10 ] Beyond that, more layers do not add to the function approximator ability of the network. Deep models (CAP > two) are able to extract better features than shallow models and hence, extra layers help in learning the features effectively. Deep learning architectures can be constructed with a greedy layer-by-layer method. [ 11 ] Deep learning helps to disentangle these abstractions and pick out which features improve performance. [ 8 ] Deep learning algorithms can be applied to unsupervised learning tasks. This is an important benefit because unlabeled data is more abundant than the labeled data.

[ 18 ] Recent work also showed that universal approximation also holds for non-bounded activation functions such as Kunihiko Fukushima 's rectified linear unit . [ 25 ] [ 26 ] The universal approximation theorem for deep neural networks concerns the capacity of networks with bounded width but the depth is allowed to grow. Lu et al. [ 21 ] proved that if the width of a deep neural network with ReLU activation is strictly larger than the input dimension, then the network can approximate any Lebesgue integrable function ; if the width is smaller or equal to the input dimension, then a deep neural network is not a universal approximator.

The probabilistic interpretation [ 24 ] derives from the field of machine learning . It features inference, [ 23 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 12 ] [ 24 ] as well as the optimization concepts of training and testing , related to fitting and generalization , respectively. More specifically, the probabilistic interpretation considers the activation nonlinearity as a cumulative distribution function . [ 24 ] The probabilistic interpretation led to the introduction of dropout as regularizer in neural networks. The probabilistic interpretation was introduced by researchers including Hopfield , Widrow and Narendra and popularized in surveys such as the one by Bishop . [ 27 ] There are two types of artificial neural network (ANN): feedforward neural network (FNN) or multilayer perceptron (MLP) and recurrent neural networks (RNN). RNNs have cycles in their connectivity structure, FNNs don't. In the 1920s, Wilhelm Lenz and Ernst Ising created the Ising model [ 28 ] [ 29 ] which is essentially a non-learning RNN architecture consisting of neuron-like threshold elements. In 1972, Shun'ichi Amari made this architecture adaptive. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] His learning RNN was republished by John Hopfield in 1982. [ 32 ] Other early recurrent neural networks were published by Kaoru Nakano in 1971. [ 33 ] [ 34 ] Already in 1948, Alan Turing produced work on \"Intelligent Machinery\" that was not published in his lifetime, [ 35 ] containing \"ideas related to artificial evolution and learning RNNs\".

[ 31 ] Frank Rosenblatt (1958) [ 36 ] proposed the perceptron, an MLP with 3 layers: an input layer, a hidden layer with randomized weights that did not learn, and an output layer. He later published a 1962 book that also introduced variants and computer experiments, including a version with four-layer perceptrons \"with adaptive preterminal networks\" where the last two layers have learned weights (here he credits H. D. Block and B. W. Knight). [ 37 ] : section 16 The book cites an earlier network by R. D. Joseph (1960) [ 38 ] \"functionally equivalent to a variation of\" this four-layer system (the book mentions Joseph over 30 times). Should Joseph therefore be considered the originator of proper adaptive multilayer perceptrons with learning hidden units? Unfortunately, the learning algorithm was not a functional one, and fell into oblivion. The first working deep learning algorithm was the Group method of data handling , a method to train arbitrarily deep neural networks, published by Alexey Ivakhnenko and Lapa in 1965. They regarded it as a form of polynomial regression, [ 39 ] or a generalization of Rosenblatt's perceptron to handle more complex, nonlinear, and hierarchical relationships. [ 40 ] A 1971 paper described a deep network with eight layers trained by this method, [ 41 ] which is based on layer by layer training through regression analysis. Superfluous hidden units are pruned using a separate validation set.

[ 31 ] The first deep learning multilayer perceptron trained by stochastic gradient descent [ 42 ] was published in 1967 by Shun'ichi Amari . [ 43 ] In computer experiments conducted by Amari's student Saito, a five layer MLP with two modifiable layers learned internal representations to classify non-linearily separable pattern classes. [ 31 ] Subsequent developments in hardware and hyperparameter tunings have made end-to-end stochastic gradient descent the currently dominant training technique. In 1969, Kunihiko Fukushima introduced the ReLU (rectified linear unit) activation function . [ 25 ] [ 31 ] The rectifier has become the most popular activation function for deep learning. [ 44 ] Deep learning architectures for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with convolutional layers and downsampling layers began with the Neocognitron introduced by Kunihiko Fukushima in 1979, though not trained by backpropagation. [ 45 ] [ 46 ] Backpropagation is an efficient application of the chain rule derived by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1673 [ 47 ] to networks of differentiable nodes. The terminology \"back-propagating errors\" was actually introduced in 1962 by Rosenblatt, [ 37 ] but he did not know how to implement this, although Henry J. Kelley had a continuous precursor of backpropagation in 1960 in the context of control theory . [ 48 ] The modern form of backpropagation was first published in Seppo Linnainmaa 's master thesis (1970). [ 49 ] [ 50 ] [ 31 ] G.M. Ostrovski et al. republished it in 1971.

In 1986, David E. Rumelhart et al. popularised backpropagation but did not cite the original work. [ 55 ] [ 56 ] The time delay neural network (TDNN) was introduced in 1987 by Alex Waibel to apply CNN to phoneme recognition. It used convolutions, weight sharing, and backpropagation. [ 57 ] [ 58 ] In 1988, Wei Zhang applied a backpropagation-trained CNN to alphabet recognition. [ 59 ] In 1989, Yann LeCun et al. created a CNN called LeNet for recognizing handwritten ZIP codes on mail. Training required 3 days. [ 60 ] In 1990, Wei Zhang implemented a CNN on optical computing hardware. [ 61 ] In 1991, a CNN was applied to medical image object segmentation [ 62 ] and breast cancer detection in mammograms. [ 63 ] LeNet -5 (1998), a 7-level CNN by Yann LeCun et al., that classifies digits, was applied by several banks to recognize hand-written numbers on checks digitized in 32x32 pixel images. [ 64 ] Recurrent neural networks (RNN) [ 28 ] [ 30 ] were further developed in the 1980s. Recurrence is used for sequence processing, and when a recurrent network is unrolled, it mathematically resembles a deep feedforward layer. Consequently, they have similar properties and issues, and their developments had mutual influences.

In the 1980s, backpropagation did not work well for deep learning with long credit assignment paths. To overcome this problem, in 1991, Jürgen Schmidhuber proposed a hierarchy of RNNs pre-trained one level at a time by self-supervised learning where each RNN tries to predict its own next input, which is the next unexpected input of the RNN below. [ 67 ] [ 68 ] This \"neural history compressor\" uses predictive coding to learn internal representations at multiple self-organizing time scales. This can substantially facilitate downstream deep learning. The RNN hierarchy can be collapsed into a single RNN, by distilling a higher level chunker network into a lower level automatizer network. [ 67 ] [ 68 ] [ 31 ] In 1993, a neural history compressor solved a \"Very Deep Learning\" task that required more than 1000 subsequent layers in an RNN unfolded in time.

That LSTM was not yet the modern architecture, which required a \"forget gate\", introduced in 1999, [ 73 ] which became the standard RNN architecture. In 1991, Jürgen Schmidhuber also published adversarial neural networks that contest with each other in the form of a zero-sum game , where one network's gain is the other network's loss. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] The first network is a generative model that models a probability distribution over output patterns. The second network learns by gradient descent to predict the reactions of the environment to these patterns. This was called \"artificial curiosity\". In 2014, this principle was used in generative adversarial networks (GANs). [ 76 ] During 1985–1995, inspired by statistical mechanics, several architectures and methods were developed by Terry Sejnowski , Peter Dayan , Geoffrey Hinton , etc., including the Boltzmann machine , [ 77 ] restricted Boltzmann machine , [ 78 ] Helmholtz machine , [ 79 ] and the wake-sleep algorithm .

[ 86 ] Key difficulties have been analyzed, including gradient diminishing [ 70 ] and weak temporal correlation structure in neural predictive models. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] Additional difficulties were the lack of training data and limited computing power. Most speech recognition researchers moved away from neural nets to pursue generative modeling. An exception was at SRI International in the late 1990s. Funded by the US government's NSA and DARPA , SRI researched in speech and speaker recognition . The speaker recognition team led by Larry Heck reported significant success with deep neural networks in speech processing in the 1998 NIST Speaker Recognition benchmark.

[ citation needed ] In 2003, LSTM became competitive with traditional speech recognizers on certain tasks.

The 2009 NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning for Speech Recognition was motivated by the limitations of deep generative models of speech, and the possibility that given more capable hardware and large-scale data sets that deep neural nets might become practical. It was believed that pre-training DNNs using generative models of deep belief nets (DBN) would overcome the main difficulties of neural nets. However, it was discovered that replacing pre-training with large amounts of training data for straightforward backpropagation when using DNNs with large, context-dependent output layers produced error rates dramatically lower than then-state-of-the-art Gaussian mixture model (GMM)/Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and also than more-advanced generative model-based systems.

[ 11 ] The next decade saw studies based on more rigorous mathematical analysis and quantitative aspects of computer vision. These include the concept of scale-space , the inference of shape from various cues such as shading , texture and focus, and contour models known as snakes . Researchers also realized that many of these mathematical concepts could be treated within the same optimization framework as regularization and Markov random fields .

These results have led to a sub-field within computer vision where artificial systems are designed to mimic the processing and behavior of biological systems at different levels of complexity. Also, some of the learning-based methods developed within computer vision ( e.g. neural net and deep learning based image and feature analysis and classification) have their background in neurobiology. The Neocognitron , a neural network developed in the 1970s by Kunihiko Fukushima , is an early example of computer vision taking direct inspiration from neurobiology, specifically the primary visual cortex . Some strands of computer vision research are closely related to the study of biological vision —indeed, just as many strands of AI research are closely tied with research into human intelligence and the use of stored knowledge to interpret, integrate, and utilize visual information.

This implies that the basic techniques that are used and developed in these fields are similar, something which can be interpreted as there is only one field with different names. On the other hand, it appears to be necessary for research groups, scientific journals, conferences, and companies to present or market themselves as belonging specifically to one of these fields and, hence, various characterizations which distinguish each of the fields from the others have been presented. In image processing, the input and output are both images, whereas in computer vision, the input is an image or video, and the output could be an enhanced image, an analysis of the image's content, or even a system's behavior based on that analysis. Computer graphics produces image data from 3D models, and computer vision often produces 3D models from image data. [ 25 ] There"

[ 25 ] There is also a trend towards a combination of the two disciplines, e.g. , as explored in augmented reality . The following characterizations appear relevant but should not be taken as universally accepted: Photogrammetry also overlaps with computer vision, e.g., stereophotogrammetry vs. computer stereo vision . Applications range from tasks such as industrial machine vision systems which, say, inspect bottles speeding by on a production line, to research into artificial intelligence and computers or robots that can comprehend the world around them. The computer vision and machine vision fields have significant overlap. Computer vision covers the core technology of automated image analysis which is used in many fields. Machine vision usually refers to a process of combining automated image analysis with other methods and technologies to provide automated inspection and robot guidance in industrial applications. In many computer-vision applications, computers are pre-programmed to solve a particular task, but methods based on learning are now becoming increasingly common. Examples of applications of computer vision include systems for: For 2024, the leading areas of computer vision were industry (market size US$5.22 billion), [ 34 ] medicine (market size US$2.6 billion), [ 35 ] military (market size US$996.2 million). [ 36 ] One of the most prominent application fields is medical computer vision , or medical image processing, characterized by the extraction of information from image data to diagnose a patient.

It also supports medical research by providing new information: e.g. , about the structure of the brain or the quality of medical treatments. Applications of computer vision in the medical area also include enhancement of images interpreted by humans— ultrasonic images or X-ray images , for example—to reduce the influence of noise. A second application area in computer vision is in industry, sometimes called machine vision , where information is extracted for the purpose of supporting a production process. One example is quality control where details or final products are being automatically inspected in order to find defects. One of the most prevalent fields for such inspection is the Wafer industry in which every single Wafer is being measured and inspected for inaccuracies or defects to prevent a computer chip from coming to market in an unusable manner. Another example is a measurement of the position and orientation of details to be picked up by a robot arm. Machine vision is also heavily used in the agricultural processes to remove undesirable foodstuff from bulk material, a process called optical sorting . [ 38 ] The obvious examples are the detection of enemy soldiers or vehicles and missile guidance . More advanced systems for missile guidance send the missile to an area rather than a specific target, and target selection is made when the missile reaches the area based on locally acquired image data.

Modern military concepts, such as \"battlefield awareness\", imply that various sensors, including image sensors, provide a rich set of information about a combat scene that can be used to support strategic decisions. In this case, automatic processing of the data is used to reduce complexity and to fuse information from multiple sensors to increase reliability. One of the newer application areas is autonomous vehicles, which include submersibles , land-based vehicles (small robots with wheels, cars, or trucks), aerial vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAV ). The level of autonomy ranges from fully autonomous (unmanned) vehicles to vehicles where computer-vision-based systems support a driver or a pilot in various situations. Fully autonomous vehicles typically use computer vision for navigation, e.g., for knowing where they are or mapping their environment ( SLAM ), for detecting obstacles. It can also be used for detecting certain task-specific events, e.g. , a UAV looking for forest fires. Examples of supporting systems are obstacle warning systems in cars, cameras and LiDAR sensors in vehicles, and systems for autonomous landing of aircraft. Several car manufacturers have demonstrated systems for autonomous driving of cars . There are ample examples of military autonomous vehicles ranging from advanced missiles to UAVs for recon missions or missile guidance.

Rubber can be used in order to create a mold that can be placed over a finger, inside of this mold would be multiple strain gauges. The finger mold and sensors could then be placed on top of a small sheet of rubber containing an array of rubber pins. A user can then wear the finger mold and trace a surface. A computer can then read the data from the strain gauges and measure if one or more of the pins are being pushed upward. If a pin is being pushed upward then the computer can recognize this as an imperfection in the surface. This sort of technology is useful in order to receive accurate data on imperfections on a very large surface. [ 39 ] Another variation of this finger mold sensor are sensors that contain a camera suspended in silicon. The silicon forms a dome around the outside of the camera and embedded in the silicon are point markers that are equally spaced. These cameras can then be placed on devices such as robotic hands in order to allow the computer to receive highly accurate tactile data.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images (the input of the retina) into descriptions of the world that can interface with other thought processes and elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory. [ 45 ] The classical problem in computer vision, image processing, and machine vision is that of determining whether or not the image data contains some specific object, feature, or activity. Different varieties of recognition problem are described in the literature. [ 46 ] Currently, the best algorithms for such tasks are based on convolutional neural networks . An illustration of their capabilities is given by the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge ; this is a benchmark in object classification and detection, with millions of images and 1000 object classes used in the competition.

NLP is a subfield of computer science and is closely associated with artificial intelligence . NLP is also related to information retrieval , knowledge representation , computational linguistics , and linguistics more broadly. [ 1 ] Major processing tasks in an NLP system include: speech recognition , text classification , natural language understanding , and natural language generation . Natural language processing has its roots in the 1950s. [ 2 ] Already in 1950, Alan Turing published an article titled \" Computing Machinery and Intelligence \" which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence, though at the time that was not articulated as a problem separate from artificial intelligence. The proposed test includes a task that involves the automated interpretation and generation of natural language. The premise of symbolic NLP is often illustrated using John Searle's Chinese room thought experiment: Given a collection of rules (e.g., a Chinese phrasebook, with questions and matching answers), the computer emulates natural language understanding (or other NLP tasks) by applying those rules to the data it confronts. Up until the 1980s, most natural language processing systems were based on complex sets of hand-written rules. Starting in the late 1980s, however, there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing. This shift was influenced by increasing computational power (see Moore's law ) and a decline in the dominance of Chomskyan linguistic theories... (e.g. transformational grammar ), whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged the sort of corpus linguistics that underlies the machine-learning approach to language processing.

Machine learning approaches, which include both statistical and neural networks, on the other hand, have many advantages over the symbolic approach: Rule-based systems are commonly used: In the late 1980s and mid-1990s, the statistical approach ended a period of AI winter , which was caused by the inefficiencies of the rule-based approaches. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] The earliest decision trees , producing systems of hard if–then rules , were still very similar to the old rule-based approaches. Only the introduction of hidden Markov models , applied to part-of-speech tagging, announced the end of the old rule-based approach. A major drawback of statistical methods is that they require elaborate feature engineering . Since 2015, [ 23 ] neural network –based methods have increasingly replaced traditional statistical approaches, using semantic networks [ 24 ] and word embeddings to capture semantic properties of words. Intermediate tasks (e.g., part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing) are not needed anymore. Neural machine translation , based on then-newly invented sequence-to-sequence transformations, made obsolete the intermediate steps, such as word alignment, previously necessary for statistical machine translation .

Though natural language processing tasks are closely intertwined, they can be subdivided into categories for convenience. A coarse division is given below. Based on long-standing trends in the field, it is possible to extrapolate future directions of NLP. As of 2020, three trends among the topics of the long-standing series of CoNLL Shared Tasks can be observed: [ 48 ] Most higher-level NLP applications involve aspects that emulate intelligent behavior and apparent comprehension of natural language. More broadly speaking, the technical operationalization of increasingly advanced aspects of cognitive behavior represents one of the developmental trajectories of NLP (see trends among CoNLL shared tasks above). Cognition refers to \"the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses.\" [ 49 ] Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary, scientific study of the mind and its processes. [ 50 ] Cognitive linguistics is an interdisciplinary branch of linguistics, combining knowledge and research from both psychology and linguistics. [ 51 ] Especially during the age of symbolic NLP , the area of computational linguistics maintained strong ties with cognitive studies. As an example, George Lakoff offers a methodology to build natural language processing (NLP) algorithms through the perspective of cognitive science, along with the findings of cognitive linguistics, [ 52 ] with two defining aspects: Ties with cognitive linguistics are part of the historical heritage of NLP, but they have been less frequently addressed since the statistical turn during the 1990s.

More recently, ideas of cognitive NLP have been revived as an approach to achieve explainability , e.g., under the notion of \"cognitive AI\".

(A classical computer can, in principle, be replicated by a classical mechanical device , with only a simple multiple of time cost. On the other hand (it is believed), a quantum computer would require exponentially more time and energy to be simulated classically.) It is widely believed that a quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster than any classical computer. For example, a large-scale quantum computer could break some widely used public-key cryptographic schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations . However, current hardware implementations of quantum computation are largely experimental and only suitable for specialized tasks. The basic unit of information in quantum computing, the qubit (or \"quantum bit\"), serves the same function as the bit in ordinary or \"classical\" computing.

Researchers have claimed, and are widely believed to be correct, that certain quantum devices can outperform classical computers on narrowly defined tasks, a milestone referred to as quantum advantage or quantum supremacy . These tasks are not necessarily useful for real-world applications. For many years, the fields of quantum mechanics and computer science formed distinct academic communities.

In general, the vector space for an n -qubit system is 2 n -dimensional, and this makes it challenging for a classical computer to simulate a quantum one: representing a 100-qubit system requires storing 2 100 classical values. The state of this one-qubit quantum memory can be manipulated by applying quantum logic gates , analogous to how classical memory can be manipulated with classical logic gates . One important gate for both classical and quantum computation is the NOT gate, which can be represented by a matrix X := ( 0 1 1 0 ) . {\\displaystyle X:={\\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\\\1&0\\end{pmatrix}}.} Mathematically, the application of such a logic gate to a quantum state vector is modeled with matrix multiplication . Thus The mathematics of single-qubit gates can be extended to operate on multi-qubit quantum memories in two important ways. One way is simply to select a qubit and apply that gate to the target qubit while leaving the remainder of the memory unaffected. Another way is to apply the gate to its target only if another part of the memory is in a desired state. These two choices can be illustrated using another example. The possible states of a two-qubit quantum memory are | 00 ⟩ := ( 1 0 0 0 ) ; | 01 ⟩ := ( 0 1 0 0 ) ; | 10 ⟩ := ( 0 0 1 0 ) ; | 11 ⟩ := ( 0 0 0 1 ) . {\\displaystyle |00\\rangle :={\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\\\0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}};\\quad |01\\rangle :={\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\1\\\\0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}};\\quad |10\\rangle :={\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\0\\\\1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}};\\quad |11\\rangle :={\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\0\\\\0\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}}.} The controlled NOT (CNOT) gate can then be represented using the following matrix: CNOT := ( 1 0 0"

However, any measurement can be deferred to the end of quantum computation, though this deferment may come at a computational cost, so most quantum circuits depict a network consisting only of quantum logic gates and no measurements.

The resulting state encodes the function's output values for all input values in the superposition, enabling the simultaneous computation of multiple outputs. This property is key to the speedup of many quantum algorithms. However, \"parallelism\" in this sense is insufficient to speed up a computation, because the measurement at the end of the computation gives only one value. To be useful, a quantum algorithm must also incorporate some other conceptual ingredient. [ 37 ] [ 38 ] There are multiple models of computation for quantum computing, distinguished by the basic elements in which the computation is decomposed. A quantum gate array decomposes computation into a sequence of few-qubit quantum gates . A quantum computation can be described as a network of quantum logic gates and measurements.

Though this gate set is infinite, it can be replaced with a finite gate set by appealing to the Solovay-Kitaev theorem . Implementation of Boolean functions using the few-qubit quantum gates is presented here. [ 39 ] A measurement-based quantum computer decomposes computation into a sequence of Bell state measurements and single-qubit quantum gates applied to a highly entangled initial state (a cluster state ), using a technique called quantum gate teleportation . An adiabatic quantum computer , based on quantum annealing , decomposes computation into a slow continuous transformation of an initial Hamiltonian into a final Hamiltonian, whose ground states contain the solution. [ 40 ] Neuromorphic quantum computing (abbreviated 'n.quantum computing') is an unconventional process of computing that uses neuromorphic computing to perform quantum operations. It was suggested that quantum algorithms, which are algorithms that run on a realistic model of quantum computation, can be computed equally efficiently with neuromorphic quantum computing. Both traditional quantum computing and neuromorphic quantum computing are physics-based unconventional computing approaches to computations and do not follow the von Neumann architecture .

A topological quantum computer decomposes computation into the braiding of anyons in a 2D lattice. [ 41 ] A quantum Turing machine is the quantum analog of a Turing machine . [ 8 ] All of these models of computation—quantum circuits, [ 42 ] one-way quantum computation , [ 43 ] adiabatic quantum computation, [ 44 ] and topological quantum computation [ 45 ] —have been shown to be equivalent to the quantum Turing machine; given a perfect implementation of one such quantum computer, it can simulate all the others with no more than polynomial overhead. This equivalence need not hold for practical quantum computers, since the overhead of simulation may be too large to be practical. The threshold theorem shows how increasing the number of qubits can mitigate errors, [ 46 ] yet fully fault-tolerant quantum computing remains \"a rather distant dream\". [ 47 ] According to some researchers, noisy intermediate-scale quantum ( NISQ ) machines may have specialized uses in the near future, but noise in quantum gates limits their reliability. [ 47 ] Scientists at Harvard University successfully created \"quantum circuits\" that correct errors more efficiently than alternative methods, which may potentially remove a major obstacle to practical quantum computers.

Conventional encryption, the obscuring of a message with a key through an algorithm, relies on the algorithm being difficult to reverse. Encryption is also the basis for digital signatures and authentication mechanisms. Quantum computing may be sufficiently more powerful that difficult reversals are feasible, allowing messages relying on conventional encryption to be read.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] The field has evolved due to the convergence of multiple technologies, including ubiquitous computing , commodity sensors , increasingly powerful embedded systems , and machine learning . [ 9 ] Traditional fields of embedded systems , wireless sensor networks , control systems, and automation independently and collectively enable the Internet of Things.

At the same time, the way these devices communicate wirelessly creates regulatory ambiguities, complicating jurisdictional boundaries of the data transfer.

This data can be used to automate farming techniques, make informed decisions to improve quality and quantity, minimize risk and waste, and reduce the effort required to manage crops. For example, farmers can now monitor soil temperature and moisture from afar and even apply IoT-acquired data to precision fertilization programs.

It focuses on protecting computer software , systems , and networks from threats that can lead to unauthorized information disclosure, theft or damage to hardware , software , or data , as well as to the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] The growing significance of computer insecurity also reflects the increasing dependence on computer systems , the Internet , [ 3 ] and evolving wireless network standards . This reliance has expanded with the proliferation of smart devices , including smartphones , televisions , and other components of the Internet of things (IoT). As digital infrastructure becomes more embedded in everyday life, cyber security has emerged as a critical concern. The complexity of modern information systems —and the societal functions they underpin—has introduced new vulnerabilities. Systems that manage essential services, such as power grids , electoral processes , and finance , are particularly sensitive to security breaches. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Although many aspects of computer security involve digital security, such as electronic passwords and encryption , physical security measures, such as metal locks are still used to prevent unauthorized tampering. IT security is not a perfect subset of information security , therefore does not completely align with the security convergence schema. A vulnerability refers to a flaw in the structure, execution, functioning, or internal oversight of a computer or system that compromises its security. Most of the vulnerabilities that have been discovered are documented in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database.

[ 10 ] In April 2023, the United Kingdom Department for Science, Innovation & Technology released a report on cyber attacks over the previous 12 months. [ 11 ] They surveyed 2,263 UK businesses, 1,174 UK registered charities, and 554 education institutions. The research found that \"32% of businesses and 24% of charities overall recall any breaches or attacks from the last 12 months.\" These figures were much higher for \"medium businesses (59%), large businesses (69%), and high-income charities with £500,000 or more in annual income (56%).\" [ 11 ] Yet, although medium or large businesses are more often the victims, since larger companies have generally improved their security over the last decade, small and midsize businesses (SMBs) have also become increasingly vulnerable as they often \"do not have advanced tools to defend the business.\" [ 10 ] SMBs are most likely to be affected by malware, ransomware, phishing, man-in-the-middle attacks , and Denial-of Service (DoS) Attacks.

These strategies mostly include phishing , ransomware , water holing and scanning. [ 12 ] To secure a computer system, it is important to understand the attacks that can be made against it, and these threats can typically be classified into one of the following categories: A backdoor in a computer system, a cryptosystem , or an algorithm is any secret method of bypassing normal authentication or security controls. These weaknesses may exist for many reasons, including original design or poor configuration. [ 13 ] Due to the nature of backdoors, they are of greater concern to companies and databases as opposed to individuals. Backdoors may be added by an authorized party to allow some legitimate access or by an attacker for malicious reasons. Criminals often use malware to install backdoors, giving them remote administrative access to a system. [ 14 ] Once they have access, cybercriminals can \"modify files, steal personal information, install unwanted software, and even take control of the entire computer.\" [ 14 ] Backdoors can be difficult to detect, as they often remain hidden within the source code or system firmware intimate knowledge of the operating system of the computer.

While a network attack from a single IP address can be blocked by adding a new firewall rule, many forms of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are possible, where the attack comes from a large number of points. In this case, defending against these attacks is much more difficult. Such attacks can originate from the zombie computers of a botnet or from a range of other possible techniques, including distributed reflective denial-of-service (DRDoS), where innocent systems are fooled into sending traffic to the victim. [ 15 ] With such attacks, the amplification factor makes the attack easier for the attacker because they have to use little bandwidth themselves. To understand why attackers may carry out these attacks, see the 'attacker motivation' section. A direct-access attack is when an unauthorized user (an attacker) gains physical access to a computer, most likely to directly copy data from it or steal information. [ 16 ] Attackers may also compromise security by making operating system modifications, installing software worms , keyloggers , covert listening devices or using wireless microphones.

[ 17 ] The attacks \"take advantage of a feature of modern computers that allows certain devices, such as external hard drives, graphics cards, or network cards, to access the computer's memory directly.\" [ 17 ] Eavesdropping is the act of surreptitiously listening to a private computer conversation (communication), usually between hosts on a network. It typically occurs when a user connects to a network where traffic is not secured or encrypted and sends sensitive business data to a colleague, which, when listened to by an attacker, could be exploited. [ 18 ] Data transmitted across an open network allows an attacker to exploit a vulnerability and intercept it via various methods. Unlike malware , direct-access attacks, or other forms of cyber attacks, eavesdropping attacks are unlikely to negatively affect the performance of networks or devices, making them difficult to notice. [ 18 ] In fact, \"the attacker does not need to have any ongoing connection to the software at all.

[ 20 ] Programs such as Carnivore and NarusInSight have been used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the NSA to eavesdrop on the systems of internet service providers . Even machines that operate as a closed system (i.e., with no contact with the outside world) can be eavesdropped upon by monitoring the faint electromagnetic transmissions generated by the hardware. TEMPEST is a specification by the NSA referring to these attacks. Malicious software ( malware ) is any software code or computer program \"intentionally written to harm a computer system or its users.\" [ 21 ] Once present on a computer, it can leak sensitive details such as personal information, business information and passwords, can give control of the system to the attacker, and can corrupt or delete data permanently.

In this sense, they are \"multi-vectored\" (i.e. the attack can use multiple means of propagation such as via the Web, email and applications). However, they are also multi-staged, meaning that \"they can infiltrate networks and move laterally inside the network.\" [ 27 ] The attacks can be polymorphic, meaning that the cyberattacks used such as viruses, worms or trojans \"constantly change (\"morph\") making it nearly impossible to detect them using signature-based defences.\" [ 27 ] Phishing is the attempt to acquire sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details directly from users by deceiving the users. [ 28 ] Phishing is typically carried out by email spoofing , instant messaging , text message , or on a phone call. They often direct users to enter details at a fake website whose look and feel are almost identical to the legitimate one. [ 29 ] The fake website often asks for personal information, such as login details and passwords. This information can then be used to gain access to the individual's real account on the real website. Preying on a victim's trust, phishing can be classified as a form of social engineering .

Spear-phishing attacks target specific individuals, rather than the broad net cast by phishing attempts. [ 31 ] Privilege escalation describes a situation where an attacker with some level of restricted access is able to, without authorization, elevate their privileges or access level. [ 32 ] For example, a standard computer user may be able to exploit a vulnerability in the system to gain access to restricted data; or even become root and have full unrestricted access to a system. The severity of attacks can range from attacks simply sending an unsolicited email to a ransomware attack on large amounts of data. Privilege escalation usually starts with social engineering techniques, often phishing . [ 32 ] Privilege escalation can be separated into two strategies, horizontal and vertical privilege escalation: Any computational system affects its environment in some form. This effect it has on its environment can range from electromagnetic radiation, to residual effect on RAM cells which as a consequence make a Cold boot attack possible, to hardware implementation faults that allow for access or guessing of other values that normally should be inaccessible.

[ 34 ] This generally involves exploiting people's trust, and relying on their cognitive biases . A common scam involves emails sent to accounting and finance department personnel, impersonating their CEO and urgently requesting some action. One of the main techniques of social engineering are phishing attacks. In early 2016, the FBI reported that such business email compromise (BEC) scams had cost US businesses more than $2 billion in about two years. [ 35 ] In May 2016, the Milwaukee Bucks NBA team was the victim of this type of cyber scam with a perpetrator impersonating the team's president Peter Feigin , resulting in the handover of all the team's employees' 2015 W-2 tax forms.

It is an intentional but unauthorized act resulting in the modification of a system, components of systems, its intended behavior, or data. So-called Evil Maid attacks and security services planting of surveillance capability into routers are examples. [ 41 ] HTML smuggling allows an attacker to smuggle a malicious code inside a particular HTML or web page. [ 42 ] HTML files can carry payloads concealed as benign, inert data in order to defeat content filters . These payloads can be reconstructed on the other side of the filter.

Information security culture is the \"...totality of patterns of behavior in an organization that contributes to the protection of information of all kinds.\" [ 44 ] Andersson and Reimers (2014) found that employees often do not see themselves as part of their organization's information security effort and often take actions that impede organizational changes.

[ 46 ] Research shows information security culture needs to be improved continuously. In \"Information Security Culture from Analysis to Change\", authors commented, \"It's a never-ending process, a cycle of evaluation and change or maintenance.\" To manage the information security culture, five steps should be taken: pre-evaluation, strategic planning, operative planning, implementation, and post-evaluation. [ 47 ] In computer security, a countermeasure is an action, device, procedure or technique that reduces a threat, a vulnerability, or an attack by eliminating or preventing it, by minimizing the harm it can cause, or by discovering and reporting it so that corrective action can be taken. [ 48 ] [ 49 ] [ 50 ] Some common countermeasures are listed in the following sections: Security by design, or alternately secure by design, means that the software has been designed from the ground up to be secure. In this case, security is considered a main feature. The UK government's National Cyber Security Centre separates secure cyber design principles into five sections: [ 51 ] These design principles of security by design can include some of the following techniques: Security architecture can be defined as the \"practice of designing computer systems to achieve security goals.\" [ 52 ] These goals have overlap with the principles of \"security by design\" explored above, including to \"make initial compromise of the system difficult,\" and to \"limit the impact of any compromise.\" [ 52 ] In practice, the role of a security architect would be to ensure the structure of a system reinforces the security of"

[ 53 ] [ 54 ] Similarly, Techopedia defines security architecture as \"a unified security design that addresses the necessities and potential risks involved in a certain scenario or environment. It also specifies when and where to apply security controls. The design process is generally reproducible.\" The key attributes of security architecture are: [ 55 ] Practicing security architecture provides the right foundation to systematically address business, IT and security concerns in an organization. A state of computer security is the conceptual ideal, attained by the use of three processes: threat prevention, detection, and response. These processes are based on various policies and system components, which include the following: Today, computer security consists mainly of preventive measures, like firewalls or an exit procedure . A firewall can be defined as a way of filtering network data between a host or a network and another network, such as the Internet . They can be implemented as software running on the machine, hooking into the network stack (or, in the case of most UNIX -based operating systems such as Linux , built into the operating system kernel ) to provide real-time filtering and blocking.

Other implements, such as palette knives, sponges, airbrushes , the artist's fingers, or even a dripping technique that uses gravity may be used. One who produces paintings is called a painter . In art , the term \"painting\" describes both the act and the result of the action (the final work is called \"a painting\"). The support for paintings includes such surfaces as walls, paper, canvas, wood, glass, lacquer , pottery, leaf , copper and concrete , and the painting may incorporate other materials, in single or multiple form, including sand, clay , paper, cardboard, newspaper, plaster , gold leaf , and even entire objects. Painting is an important form of visual art , bringing in elements such as drawing , composition , gesture , narration , and abstraction . [ 2 ] Paintings can be naturalistic and representational (as in portraits , still life and landscape painting --though these genres can also be abstract), photographic , abstract, narrative, symbolist (as in Symbolist art ), emotive (as in Expressionism ) or political in nature (as in Artivism ). A significant share of the history of painting in both Eastern and Western art is dominated by religious art . Examples of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery , to Biblical scenes on the Sistine Chapel ceiling , to scenes from the life of Buddha (or other images of Eastern religious origin ).

In the East, ink and color ink historically predominated the choice of media, with equally rich and complex traditions. The invention of photography had a major impact on painting. In the decades after the first photograph was produced in 1829, photographic processes improved and became more widely practiced, depriving painting of much of its historic purpose to provide an accurate record of the observable world. A series of art movements in the late 19th and early 20th centuries—notably Impressionism , Post-Impressionism , Fauvism , Expressionism , Cubism , and Dadaism —challenged the Renaissance view of the world. Eastern and African painting, however, continued a long history of stylization and did not undergo an equivalent transformation at the same time. [ citation needed ] Modern and Contemporary art has moved away from the historic value of craft and documentation in favour of concept . This has not deterred the majority of living painters from continuing to practice painting either as a whole or part of their work.

The Feminist art movement [ 14 ] began in the 1960s during the second wave of feminism . The movement sought to gain equal rights and equal opportunities for female artists internationally. Color , made up of hue , saturation , and value , dispersed over a surface is the essence of painting, just as pitch and rhythm are the essence of music . Color is highly subjective, but has observable psychological effects, although these can differ from one culture to the next. Black is associated with mourning in the West, but in the East, white is. Some painters, theoreticians, writers, and scientists, including Goethe , [ 15 ] Kandinsky , [ 16 ] and Newton , [ 17 ] have written their own color theory . Moreover, the use of language is only an abstraction of color equivalent. The word \" red \", for example, can cover a wide range of variations from the pure red of the visible spectrum of light. There is not a formalized register of different colors in the way that there is agreement on different notes in music, such as F or C♯ . For a painter, color is not simply divided into basic (primary) and derived (complementary or mixed) colors (like red, blue, green, brown, etc.). Painters deal practically with pigments , [ 18 ] so \" blue \" for a painter can be any of the blues: phthalocyanine blue , Prussian blue , indigo , Cobalt blue , ultramarine , and so on."

Painters deal practically with pigments , [ 18 ] so \" blue \" for a painter can be any of the blues: phthalocyanine blue , Prussian blue , indigo , Cobalt blue , ultramarine , and so on. Psychological and symbolical meanings of color are not, strictly speaking, means of painting. Colors only add to the potential, derived context of meanings, and because of this, the perception of a painting is highly subjective. The analogy with music is quite clear—sound in music (like a C note) is analogous to \"light\" in painting, \"shades\" to dynamics , and \"coloration\" is to painting as the specific timbre of musical instruments is to music. These elements do not necessarily form a melody (in music) of themselves; rather, they can add different contexts to it. Modern artists have extended the practice of painting considerably to include, as one example, collage , which began with Cubism and is not painting in the strict sense. Some modern painters incorporate different materials such as metal, plastic, sand , cement , straw , leaves or wood for the texture. Examples of this are the works of Jean Dubuffet and Anselm Kiefer . There is a growing community of artists who use computers to \"paint\" color onto a digital \"canvas\" using programs such as Adobe Photoshop , Corel Painter , and many others. These images can be printed onto traditional canvas if required. Jean Metzinger 's mosaic-like Divisionist technique had its parallel in literature; a characteristic of the alliance between Symbolist writers and Neo-Impressionist artists: I ask of divided brushwork not the objective rendering of light, but iridescences and certain aspects of color still foreign to painting.

I make a kind of chromatic versification and for syllables, I use strokes which, variable in quantity, cannot differ in dimension without modifying the rhythm of a pictorial phraseology destined to translate the diverse emotions aroused by nature. (Jean Metzinger, c. 1907 ) [ 19 ] Rhythm , for artists such as Piet Mondrian , [ 20 ] [ 21 ] is important in painting as it is in music. If one defines rhythm as \"a pause incorporated into a sequence\", then there can be rhythm in paintings. These pauses allow creative force to intervene and add new creations—form, melody, coloration. The distribution of form or any kind of information is of crucial importance in the given work of art, and it directly affects the aesthetic value of that work. This is because the aesthetic value is functionality dependent, i.e. the freedom (of movement) of perception is perceived as beauty. Free flow of energy, in art as well as in other forms of \" techne \", directly contributes to the aesthetic value. [ 20 ] Music was important to the birth of abstract art since music is abstract by nature—it does not try to represent the exterior world, but expresses in an immediate way the inner feelings of the soul. Wassily Kandinsky often used musical terms to identify his works; he called his most spontaneous paintings \"improvisations\" and described more elaborate works as \"compositions\".

Kandinsky theorized that \"music is the ultimate teacher\", [ 22 ] and subsequently embarked upon the first seven of his ten Compositions . Hearing tones and chords as he painted, Kandinsky theorized that (for example), yellow is the color of middle C on a brassy trumpet; black is the color of closure, and the end of things; and that combinations of colors produce vibrational frequencies, akin to chords played on a piano. In 1871 the young Kandinsky learned to play the piano and cello. [ 23 ] [ 24 ] Kandinsky's stage design for a performance of Mussorgsky 's Pictures at an Exhibition illustrates his \"synaesthetic\" concept of a universal correspondence of forms, colors and musical sounds. [ 25 ] Music defines much of modernist abstract painting. Jackson Pollock underscores that interest with his 1950 painting Autumn Rhythm (Number 30) . [ 26 ] Aesthetics is the study of art and beauty ; it was an important issue for 18th- and 19th-century philosophers such as Kant and Hegel . Classical philosophers like Plato and Aristotle also theorized about art and painting in particular. Plato disregarded painters (as well as sculptors) in his philosophical system; he maintained that painting cannot depict the truth —it is a copy of reality (a shadow of the world of ideas) and is nothing but a craft , similar to shoemaking or iron casting.

[ 28 ] Kant distinguished between Beauty and the Sublime , in terms that clearly gave priority to the former. [ citation needed ] Although he did not refer to painting in particular, this concept was taken up by painters such as J.M.W. Turner and Caspar David Friedrich . Hegel recognized the failure of attaining a universal concept of beauty and, in his aesthetic essay, wrote that painting is one of the three \"romantic\" arts, along with Poetry and Music , for its symbolic , highly intellectual purpose. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] Painters who have written theoretical works on painting include Kandinsky and Paul Klee . [ 31 ] [ 32 ] In his essay, Kandinsky maintains that painting has a spiritual value, and he attaches primary colors to essential feelings or concepts, something that Goethe and other writers had already tried to do. Iconography is the study of the content of paintings, rather than their style. Erwin Panofsky and other art historians first seek to understand the things depicted, before looking at their meaning for the viewer at the time, and finally analyzing their wider cultural, religious, and social meaning. [ 33 ] In 1890, the Parisian painter Maurice Denis famously asserted: \"Remember that a painting—before being a warhorse, a naked woman or some story or other—is essentially a flat surface covered with colors assembled in a certain order.\" [ 34 ] Thus, many 20th-century developments in painting, such as Cubism , were reflections"

Recent contributions to thinking about painting have been offered by the painter and writer Julian Bell. In his book What is Painting? , Bell discusses the development, through history, of the notion that paintings can express feelings and ideas. [ 35 ] In Mirror of The World, Bell writes: A work of art seeks to hold your attention and keep it fixed: a history of art urges it onwards, bulldozing a highway through the homes of the imagination. [ 36 ] Different types of paint are usually identified by the medium that the pigment is suspended or embedded in, which determines the general working characteristics of the paint, such as viscosity , miscibility , solubility , drying time, etc. Encaustic painting , also known as hot wax painting, involves using heated beeswax to which colored pigments are added. The liquid/paste is then applied to a surface—usually prepared wood, though canvas and other materials are often used. The simplest encaustic mixture can be made from adding pigments to beeswax, but there are several other recipes that can be used—some containing other types of waxes , damar resin , linseed oil , or other ingredients. Pure, powdered pigments can be purchased and used, though some mixtures use oil paints or other forms of pigment.

Other materials can be encased or collaged into the surface, or layered, using the encaustic medium to adhere it to the surface. The technique was the normal one for ancient Greek and Roman panel paintings, and remained in use in the Eastern Orthodox icon tradition. Watercolor is a painting method in which the paints are made of pigments suspended in a water-soluble vehicle. The traditional and most common support for watercolor paintings is paper; other supports include papyrus , bark papers, plastics, vellum or leather , fabric , wood and canvas . In East Asia, watercolor painting with inks is referred to as brush painting or scroll painting. In Chinese , Korean , and Japanese painting it has been the dominant medium, often in monochrome black or browns. India, Ethiopia and other countries also have long traditions. Finger-painting with watercolor paints originated in China . There are various types of watercolors used by artists. Some examples are pan watercolors, liquid watercolors, watercolor brush pens, and watercolor pencils . Watercolor pencils (water-soluble color pencils) may be used either wet or dry. Gouache is a water-based paint consisting of pigment and other materials designed to be used in an opaque painting method.

[ 37 ] Gouache was a popular paint utilized by Egyptians, [ 38 ] Painters such as Francois Boucher used this medium. This paint is best applied with sable brushes. Glazing is commonly known as a premelted liquid glass. This glaze can be dipped or brushed on. This glaze appears chalky and there is a vast difference between the beginning and finished result. To be activated glazed pottery must be placed in a kiln to be fired. This melts the Silica glass in the glaze and transforms it into a vibrant glossy version of itself. [ 39 ] [ 40 ] Ink paintings are done with a liquid that contains pigments or dyes and is used to color a surface to produce an image, text , or design . Ink is used for drawing with a pen , brush , or quill . Ink can be a complex medium, composed of solvents , pigments, dyes, resins , lubricants , solubilizers, surfactants , particulate matter , fluorescers , and other materials. The components of inks serve many purposes; the ink's carrier, colorants, and other additives control flow and thickness of the ink and its appearance when dry. Enamels are made by painting a substrate, typically metal, with powdered glass; minerals called color oxides provide coloration.

Unlike most painted techniques, the surface can be handled and wetted. Enamels have traditionally been used for decoration of precious objects, [ 41 ] but have also been used for other purposes. Limoges enamel was the leading centre of Renaissance enamel painting, with small religious and mythological scenes in decorated surrounds, on plaques or objects such as salts or caskets. In the 18th century, enamel painting enjoyed a vogue in Europe, especially as a medium for portrait miniatures . [ 42 ] In the late 20th century, the technique of porcelain enamel on metal has been used as a durable medium for outdoor murals. [ 43 ] Tempera , also known as egg tempera, is a permanent, fast-drying painting medium consisting of colored pigment mixed with a water-soluble binder medium (usually a glutinous material such as egg yolk or some other size ). Tempera also refers to the paintings done in this medium. Tempera paintings are very long-lasting, and examples from the first centuries CE still exist. Egg tempera was a primary method of painting until after 1500 when it was superseded by the invention of oil painting .

The word fresco comes from the Italian word affresco [afˈfresːko] , which derives from the Latin word for fresh . Frescoes were often made during the Renaissance and other early time periods. Buon fresco technique consists of painting in pigment mixed with water on a thin layer of wet, fresh lime mortar or plaster , for which the Italian word for plaster, intonaco , is used. A secco painting, in contrast, is done on dry plaster ( secco is \"dry\" in Italian). The pigments require a binding medium, such as egg ( tempera ), glue or oil to attach the pigment to the wall. Oil painting is the process of painting with pigments that are bound with a medium of drying oil , such as linseed oil , poppyseed oil which was widely used in early modern Europe. Often the oil was boiled with a resin such as pine resin or even frankincense ; these were called 'varnishes' and were prized for their body and gloss. Oil paint eventually became the principal medium used for creating artworks as its advantages became widely known. The transition began with Early Netherlandish painting in northern Europe, and by the height of the Renaissance oil painting techniques had almost completely replaced tempera paints in the majority of Europe.

Sculpture is the three-dimensional art work which is physically presented in the dimensions of height, width and depth. It is one of the plastic arts . Durable sculptural processes originally used carving (the removal of material) and modelling (the addition of material, as clay), in stone , metal , ceramics , wood and other materials but, since Modernism , there has been almost complete freedom of materials and process. A wide variety of materials may be worked by removal such as carving, assembled by welding or modelling, or moulded or cast . Sculpture in stone survives far better than works of art in perishable materials, and often represents the majority of the surviving works (other than pottery ) from ancient cultures, though conversely traditions of sculpture in wood may have vanished almost entirely. In addition, most ancient sculpture was painted, which has been lost. [ 2 ] Sculpture has been central in religious devotion in many cultures, and until recent centuries, large sculptures, too expensive for private individuals to create, were usually an expression of religion or politics. Those cultures whose sculptures have survived in quantities include the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean, India and China, as well as many in Central and South America and Africa. The Western tradition of sculpture began in ancient Greece , and Greece is widely seen as producing great masterpieces in the classical period.

A distinction exists between sculpture \"in the round\"—free-standing sculpture such as statues , not attached, except possibly at the base, to any other surface—and the various types of relief , which are at least partly attached to a background surface. Relief is often classified by the degree of projection from the wall into low or bas-relief , high relief , and sometimes an intermediate mid-relief . Sunk-relief is a technique restricted to ancient Egypt . Relief is the usual sculptural medium for large-figure groups and narrative subjects, which are difficult to accomplish in the round, and is the typical technique used both for architectural sculpture , which is attached to buildings, and for small-scale sculpture decorating other objects, as in much pottery , metalwork, and jewellery . Relief sculpture may also decorate steles —upright slabs, usually of stone, often also containing inscriptions.

Cult images are common in many cultures, though they are often not the colossal statues of deities which characterized ancient Greek art , like the Statue of Zeus at Olympia . The actual cult images in the innermost sanctuaries of Egyptian temples , of which none have survived, were evidently rather small, even in the largest temples. The same is often true in Hinduism , where the very simple and ancient form of the lingam is the most common. Buddhism brought the sculpture of religious figures to East Asia , where there seems to have been no earlier equivalent tradition, though again simple shapes like the bi and cong probably had religious significance. [ citation needed ] Small sculptures as personal possessions go back to the earliest prehistoric art, and the use of very large sculpture as public art , especially to impress the viewer with the power of a ruler, goes back at least to the Great Sphinx of some 4,500 years ago. In archaeology and art history the appearance, and sometimes disappearance, of large or monumental sculpture in a culture is regarded as of great significance, though tracing the emergence is often complicated by the presumed existence of sculpture in wood and other perishable materials of which no record remains; [ 5 ] The totem pole is an example of a tradition of monumental sculpture"

The ability to summon the resources to create monumental sculpture, by transporting usually very heavy materials and arranging for the payment of what are usually regarded as full-time sculptors, is considered a mark of a relatively advanced culture in terms of social organization. Recent unexpected discoveries of ancient Chinese Bronze Age figures at Sanxingdui , some more than twice human size, have disturbed many ideas held about early Chinese civilization, since only much smaller bronzes were previously known. [ 6 ] Some undoubtedly advanced cultures, such as the Indus Valley civilization , appear to have had no monumental sculpture at all, though producing very sophisticated figurines and seals. The Mississippian culture seems to have been progressing towards its use, with small stone figures, when it collapsed. Other cultures, such as ancient Egypt and the Easter Island culture , seem to have devoted enormous resources to very large-scale monumental sculpture from a very early stage.

Precious materials such as gold , silver , jade , and ivory are often used for small luxury works, and sometimes in larger ones, as in chryselephantine statues. More common and less expensive materials were used for sculpture for wider consumption, including hardwoods (such as oak , box/boxwood , and lime/linden ); terracotta and other ceramics , wax (a very common material for models for casting, and receiving the impressions of cylinder seals and engraved gems), and cast metals such as pewter and zinc (spelter).

Sculptors sometimes use found objects , and Chinese scholar's rocks have been appreciated for many centuries. [ citation needed ] Stone sculpture is an ancient activity where pieces of rough natural stone are shaped by the controlled removal of stone . Owing to the permanence of the material, evidence can be found that even the earliest societies indulged in some form of stone work, though not all areas of the world have such abundance of good stone for carving as Egypt, Greece, India and most of Europe. Petroglyphs (also called rock engravings) are perhaps the earliest form: images created by removing part of a rock surface which remains in situ , by incising, pecking, carving, and abrading. Monumental sculpture covers large works, and architectural sculpture , which is attached to buildings. Hardstone carving is the carving for artistic purposes of semi-precious stones such as jade , agate , onyx , rock crystal , sard or carnelian , and a general term for an object made in this way. Alabaster or mineral gypsum is a soft mineral that is easy to carve for smaller works and still relatively durable.

[ 10 ] A variation of stone sculpture in the landscape is the hill figure , where the natural bedrock is used as the primary medium. The Litlington White Horse in East Sussex is an example of a 20th-century figure created by the controlled removal of turf to reveal the underlying chalk of the South Downs. Managed by the National Trust , this process—known as 'scouring', is a subtractive technique that uses the geology of a site to produce a monumental graphic work. Bronze and related copper alloys are the oldest and still the most popular metals for cast metal sculptures; a cast bronze sculpture is often called simply a \"bronze\". Common bronze alloys have the unusual and desirable property of expanding slightly just before they set, thus filling the finest details of a mould. Their strength and lack of brittleness (ductility) is an advantage when figures in action are to be created, especially when compared to various ceramic or stone materials (see marble sculpture or granite for several examples).

[ citation needed ] Casting is a group of manufacturing processes by which a liquid material (bronze, copper, glass, aluminum, iron) is (usually) poured into a mould, which contains a hollow cavity of the desired shape, and then allowed to solidify. The solid casting is then ejected or broken out to complete the process, [ 11 ] although a final stage of \"cold work\" may follow on the finished cast. Casting may be used to form hot liquid metals or various materials that cold set after mixing of components (such as epoxies , concrete , plaster and clay ). Casting is most often used for making complex shapes that would be otherwise difficult or uneconomical to make by other methods. The oldest surviving casting is a copper Mesopotamian frog from 3200 BCE. [ 12 ] Specific techniques include lost-wax casting , plaster mould casting, and sand casting .

Oxy-fuel is probably the most common method of welding when it comes to creating steel sculptures because it is the easiest to use for shaping the steel as well as making clean and less noticeable joins of the steel. The key to Oxy-fuel welding is heating each piece of metal to be joined evenly until all are red and have a shine to them. Once that shine is on each piece, that shine will soon become a 'pool' where the metal is liquified and the welder must get the pools to join, fusing the metal. Once cooled off, the location where the pools joined are now one continuous piece of metal. Also used heavily in Oxy-fuel sculpture creation is forging. Forging is the process of heating metal to a certain point to soften it enough to be shaped into different forms. One very common example is heating the end of a steel rod and hitting the red heated tip with a hammer while on an anvil to form a point. In between hammer swings, the forger rotates the rod and gradually forms a sharpened point from the blunt end of a steel rod.

It can be carved, though with considerable difficulty; the Roman Lycurgus Cup is all but unique.

Hot glass can also be blown and/or hot sculpted with hand tools either as a solid mass or as part of a blown object. More recent techniques involve chiseling and bonding plate glass with polymer silicates and UV light. [ 14 ] Pottery is one of the oldest materials for sculpture, as well as clay being the medium in which many sculptures cast in metal are originally modelled for casting. Sculptors often build small preliminary works called maquettes of ephemeral materials such as plaster of Paris , wax, unfired clay, or plasticine . [ 15 ] Many cultures have produced pottery which combines a function as a vessel with a sculptural form, and small figurines have often been as popular as they are in modern Western culture. Stamps and moulds were used by most ancient civilizations, from ancient Rome and Mesopotamia to China.

It is the oldest form of drama , though live theatre has now been joined by modern recorded forms. Elements of art, such as painted scenery and stagecraft such as lighting are used to enhance the physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience.

Modern Western theatre comes, in large measure, from the theatre of ancient Greece , from which it borrows technical terminology, classification into genres , and many of its themes , stock characters , and plot elements.

Aristotle defined comedy as a representation of laughable people that involves some kind of blunder or ugliness that does not cause pain or disaster. [ l ] In addition to the categories of comedy and tragedy at the City Dionysia, the festival also included the Satyr Play . Finding its origins in rural, agricultural rituals dedicated to Dionysus, the satyr play eventually found its way to Athens in its most well-known form. Satyr's themselves were tied to the god Dionysus as his loyal woodland companions, often engaging in drunken revelry and mischief at his side. The satyr play itself was classified as tragicomedy, erring on the side of the more modern burlesque traditions of the early twentieth century. The plotlines of the plays were typically concerned with the dealings of the pantheon of Gods and their involvement in human affairs, backed by the chorus of Satyrs . However, according to Webster , satyr actors did not always perform typical satyr actions and would break from the acting traditions assigned to the character type of a mythical forest creature.

Following the expansion of the Roman Republic (509–27 BC) into several Greek territories between 270 and 240 BC, Rome encountered Greek drama . [ 46 ] From the later years of the republic and by means of the Roman Empire (27 BC-476 AD), theatre spread west across Europe, around the Mediterranean and reached England; Roman theatre was more varied, extensive and sophisticated than that of any culture before it.

[ 46 ] From the later years of the republic and by means of the Roman Empire (27 BC-476 AD), theatre spread west across Europe, around the Mediterranean and reached England; Roman theatre was more varied, extensive and sophisticated than that of any culture before it. [ 47 ] While Greek drama continued to be performed throughout the Roman period, the year 240 BC marks the beginning of regular Roman drama. [ 46 ] [ m ] From the beginning of the empire, however, interest in full-length drama declined in favour of a broader variety of theatrical entertainments. [ 48 ] The first important works of Roman literature were the tragedies and comedies that Livius Andronicus wrote from 240 BC. [ 49 ] Five years later, Gnaeus Naevius also began to write drama. [ 49 ] No plays from either writer have survived. While both dramatists composed in both genres , Andronicus was most appreciated for his tragedies and Naevius for his comedies; their successors tended to specialise in one or the other, which led to a separation of the subsequent development of each type of drama. [ 49 ] By the beginning of the 2nd century BC, drama was firmly established in Rome and a guild of writers ( collegium poetarum ) had been formed. [ 50 ] The Roman comedies that have survived are all fabula palliata (comedies based on Greek subjects) and come from two dramatists: Titus Maccius Plautus (Plautus) and Publius Terentius Afer (Terence). [ 51 ] In re-working the Greek originals, the Roman comic dramatists abolished the role of the chorus in dividing the drama into episodes and introduced musical accompaniment to its dialogue (between one-third of the dialogue in the comedies of Plautus and two-thirds in those of Terence).

[ 53 ] All of the six comedies that Terence wrote between 166 and 160 BC have survived; the complexity of his plots, in which he often combined several Greek originals, was sometimes denounced, but his double-plots enabled a sophisticated presentation of contrasting human behaviour. [ 53 ] No early Roman tragedy survives, though it was highly regarded in its day; historians know of three early tragedians— Quintus Ennius , Marcus Pacuvius and Lucius Accius . [ 52 ] From the time of the empire, the work of two tragedians survives—one is an unknown author, while the other is the Stoic philosopher Seneca . [ 54 ] Nine of Seneca's tragedies survive, all of which are fabula crepidata (tragedies adapted from Greek originals); his Phaedra , for example, was based on Euripides ' Hippolytus .

[ 54 ] In contrast to Ancient Greek theatre, the theatre in Ancient Rome did allow female performers. While the majority were employed for dancing and singing, a minority of actresses are known to have performed speaking roles, and there were actresses who achieved wealth, fame and recognition for their art, such as Eucharis , Dionysia , Galeria Copiola and Fabia Arete : they also formed their own acting guild, the Sociae Mimae , which was evidently quite wealthy.

[ 62 ] In doing so, it provides indications about the nature of actual theatrical practices. Sanskrit theatre was performed on sacred ground by priests who had been trained in the necessary skills (dance, music, and recitation) in a [hereditary process].

[ 62 ] The performers were trained rigorously in vocal and physical technique. [ 63 ] There were no prohibitions against female performers; companies were all-male, all-female, and of mixed gender. Certain sentiments were considered inappropriate for men to enact, however, and were thought better suited to women. Some performers played characters their own age, while others played ages different from their own (whether younger or older). Of all the elements of theatre, the Treatise gives most attention to acting ( abhinaya ), which consists of two styles: realistic ( lokadharmi ) and conventional ( natyadharmi ), though the major focus is on the latter.

The powerful Indian emperor Harsha (606–648) is credited with having written three plays: the comedy Ratnavali , Priyadarsika , and the Buddhist drama Nagananda . The Tang dynasty is sometimes known as \"The Age of 1000 Entertainments\". During this era, Ming Huang formed an acting school known as The Pear Garden to produce a form of drama that was primarily musical. That is why actors are commonly called \"Children of the Pear Garden\". During the dynasty of Empress Ling, shadow puppetry first emerged as a recognized form of theatre in China. There were two distinct forms of shadow puppetry, Pekingese (northern) and Cantonese (southern). The two styles were differentiated by the method of making the puppets and the positioning of the rods on the puppets , as opposed to the type of play performed by the puppets. Both styles generally performed plays depicting great adventure and fantasy, rarely was this very stylized form of theatre used for political propaganda.

The rods used to control Cantonese puppets were attached perpendicular to the puppets' heads. Thus, they were not seen by the audience when the shadow was created. Pekingese puppets were more delicate and smaller. They were created out of thin, translucent leather (usually taken from the belly of a donkey). They were painted with vibrant paints, thus they cast a very colourful shadow. The thin rods which controlled their movements were attached to a leather collar at the neck of the puppet. The rods ran parallel to the bodies of the puppet and then turned at a ninety degree angle to connect to the neck. While these rods were visible when the shadow was cast, they laid outside the shadow of the puppet; thus they did not interfere with the appearance of the figure. The rods are attached at the necks to facilitate the use of multiple heads with one body. When the heads were not being used, they were stored in a muslin book or fabric-lined box. The heads were always removed at night. This was in keeping with the old superstition that if left intact, the puppets would"

    "text": "Opera is a form of Western theatre in which music is a fundamental component and dramatic roles are taken by singers . Such a \"work\" (the literal translation of the Italian word \"opera\") is typically a collaboration between a composer and a librettist [ 1 ] and incorporates a number of the performing arts , such as acting , scenery , costume , and sometimes dance or ballet . The performance is typically given in an opera house , accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble , which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor . Although musical theatre is closely related to opera, the two are considered to be distinct from one another. [ 2 ] Opera is a key part of Western classical music , and Italian tradition in particular. [ 3 ] Originally understood as an entirely sung piece , in contrast to a play with songs, opera has come to include numerous genres , including some that include spoken dialogue such as Singspiel and Opéra comique . In traditional number opera , singers employ two styles of singing: recitative , a speech-inflected style, [ 4 ] and self-contained arias . The 19th century saw the rise of the continuous music drama . Opera originated in Italy at the end of the 16th century (with Jacopo Peri 's mostly lost Dafne , produced in Florence in 1598) especially from works by Claudio Monteverdi , notably L'Orfeo , and soon spread through the rest of Europe: Heinrich Schütz in Germany, Jean-Baptiste Lully in France, and Henry Purcell in England all helped to establish their national traditions in the 17th century.

Opera seria was the most prestigious form of Italian opera, until Christoph Willibald Gluck reacted against its artificiality with his \"reform\" operas in the 1760s. The most renowned figure of late 18th-century opera is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart , who began with opera seria but is most famous for his Italian comic operas , especially The Marriage of Figaro ( Le nozze di Figaro ), Don Giovanni , and Così fan tutte , as well as Die Entführung aus dem Serail ( The Abduction from the Seraglio ), and The Magic Flute ( Die Zauberflöte ), landmarks in the German tradition. The first third of the 19th century saw the high point of the bel canto style, with Gioachino Rossini , Gaetano Donizetti and Vincenzo Bellini all creating signature works of that style. It also saw the advent of grand opera typified by the works of Daniel Auber and Giacomo Meyerbeer as well as Carl Maria von Weber 's introduction of German Romantische Oper (Romantic Opera). The mid-to-late 19th century was a golden age of opera, led and dominated by Giuseppe Verdi in Italy and Richard Wagner in Germany.

With the rise of recording technology , singers such as Enrico Caruso and Maria Callas became known to much wider audiences that went beyond the circle of opera fans. Since the invention of radio and television, operas were also performed on (and written for) these media. Beginning in 2006, a number of major opera houses began to present live high-definition video transmissions of their performances in cinemas all over the world. Since 2009, complete performances can be downloaded and are live streamed . The words of an opera are known as the libretto (meaning \"small book\"). Some composers, notably Wagner, have written their own libretti; others have worked in close collaboration with their librettists, e.g. Mozart with Lorenzo Da Ponte . Traditional opera, often referred to as \" number opera \", consists of two modes of singing: recitative , the plot-driving passages sung in a style designed to imitate and emphasise the inflections of speech, [ 4 ] and aria (an \"air\" or formal song) in which the characters express their emotions in a more structured melodic style. Vocal duets, trios and other ensembles often occur, and choruses are used to comment on the action.

Melodic or semi-melodic passages occurring in the midst of, or instead of, recitative, are also referred to as arioso . The terminology of the various kinds of operatic voices is described in detail below . [ 5 ] During both the Baroque and Classical periods , recitative could appear in two basic forms, each of which was accompanied by a different instrumental ensemble: secco (dry) recitative, sung with a free rhythm dictated by the accent of the words, accompanied only by basso continuo , which was usually a harpsichord and a cello; or accompagnato (also known as strumentato ) in which the orchestra provided accompaniment. Over the 18th century, arias were increasingly accompanied by the orchestra. By the 19th century, accompagnato had gained the upper hand, the orchestra played a much bigger role, and Wagner revolutionised opera by abolishing almost all distinction between aria and recitative in his quest for what Wagner termed \" endless melody \". Subsequent composers have tended to follow Wagner 's example, though some, such as Stravinsky in his The Rake's Progress , have bucked the trend. The changing role of the orchestra in opera is described in more detail below . The Italian word opera means \"work\", both in the sense of the labour done and the result produced.

According to the Oxford English Dictionary , the Italian word was first used in the sense \"composition in which poetry, dance, and music are combined\" in 1639; the first recorded English usage in this sense dates to 1648. [ 6 ] Dafne by Jacopo Peri was the earliest composition considered opera, as understood today. It was written around 1597, largely under the inspiration of an elite circle of literate Florentine humanists who gathered as the \" Camerata de' Bardi \". Significantly, Dafne was an attempt to revive the classical Greek drama , part of the wider revival of antiquity characteristic of the Renaissance . The members of the Camerata considered that the \"chorus\" parts of Greek dramas were originally sung, and possibly even the entire text of all roles; opera was thus conceived as a way of \"restoring\" this situation. Dafne , however, is lost. A later work by Peri, Euridice , dating from 1600, is the first opera score to have survived until the present day. However, the honour of being the first opera still to be regularly performed goes to Claudio Monteverdi 's L'Orfeo , composed for the court of Mantua in 1607. [ 7 ] The Mantua court of the Gonzagas , employers of Monteverdi, played a significant role in the origin of opera employing not only court singers of the concerto delle donne (till 1598), but also one of the first actual \"opera singers\", Madama Europa .

In 1637, the idea of a \"season\" (often during the carnival ) of publicly attended operas supported by ticket sales emerged in Venice . Monteverdi had moved to the city from Mantua and composed his last operas, Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria and L'incoronazione di Poppea , for the Venetian theatre in the 1640s. His most important follower Francesco Cavalli helped spread opera throughout Italy. In these early Baroque operas, broad comedy was blended with tragic elements in a mix that jarred some educated sensibilities, sparking the first of opera's many reform movements, sponsored by the Arcadian Academy , which came to be associated with the poet Metastasio , whose libretti helped crystallise the genre of opera seria , which became the leading form of Italian opera until the end of the 18th century. Once the Metastasian ideal had been firmly established, comedy in Baroque-era opera was reserved for what came to be called opera buffa . Before such elements were forced out of opera seria, many libretti had featured a separately unfolding comic plot as sort of an \"opera-within-an-opera\". One reason for this was an attempt to attract members of the growing merchant class, newly wealthy, but still not as cultured as the nobility, to the public opera houses . These separate plots were almost immediately resurrected in a separately developing tradition that partly derived from the commedia dell'arte , a long-flourishing improvisatory stage tradition of Italy.

Just as intermedi had once been performed in between the acts of stage plays, operas in the new comic genre of intermezzi , which developed largely in Naples in the 1710s and 1720s, were initially staged during the intermissions of opera seria. They became so popular, however, that they were soon being offered as separate productions. Opera seria was elevated in tone and highly stylised in form, usually consisting of secco recitative interspersed with long da capo arias. These afforded great opportunity for virtuosic singing and during the golden age of opera seria the singer really became the star. The role of the hero was usually written for the high-pitched male castrato voice, which was produced by castration of the singer before puberty , which prevented a boy's larynx from being transformed at puberty. Castrati such as Farinelli and Senesino , as well as female sopranos such as Faustina Bordoni , became in great demand throughout Europe as opera seria ruled the stage in every country except France. Farinelli was one of the most famous singers of the 18th century. Italian opera set the Baroque standard. Italian libretti were the norm, even when a German composer like Handel found himself composing the likes of Rinaldo and Giulio Cesare for London audiences. Italian libretti remained dominant in the classical period as well, for example in the operas of Mozart , who wrote in Vienna near the century's close.

[ 9 ] Opera seria had its weaknesses and critics. The taste for embellishment on behalf of the superbly trained singers, and the use of spectacle as a replacement for dramatic purity and unity drew attacks. Francesco Algarotti 's Essay on the Opera (1755) proved to be an inspiration for Christoph Willibald Gluck 's reforms. He advocated that opera seria had to return to basics and that all the various elements—music (both instrumental and vocal), ballet , and staging—must be subservient to the overriding drama. In 1765 Melchior Grimm published \" Poème lyrique \", an influential article for the Encyclopédie on lyric and opera librettos . [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] Several composers of the period, including Niccolò Jommelli and Tommaso Traetta , attempted to put these ideals into practice. The first to succeed however, was Gluck. Gluck strove to achieve a \"beautiful simplicity\". This is evident in his first reform opera, Orfeo ed Euridice , where his non-virtuosic vocal melodies are supported by simple harmonies and a richer orchestra presence throughout. Gluck's reforms have had resonance throughout operatic history. Weber, Mozart, and Wagner, in particular, were influenced by his ideals. Mozart, in many ways Gluck's successor, combined a superb sense of drama, harmony, melody, and counterpoint to write a series of comic operas with libretti by Lorenzo Da Ponte , notably Le nozze di Figaro , Don Giovanni , and Così fan tutte , which remain among the most-loved, popular and well-known operas.

[ 15 ] The bel canto opera movement flourished in the early 19th century and is exemplified by the operas of Rossini , Bellini , Donizetti , Pacini , Mercadante and many others. Literally \"beautiful singing\", bel canto opera derives from the Italian stylistic singing school of the same name. Bel canto lines are typically florid and intricate, requiring supreme agility and pitch control. Examples of famous operas in the bel canto style include Rossini's Il barbiere di Siviglia and La Cenerentola , as well as Bellini's Norma , La sonnambula and I puritani and Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor , L'elisir d'amore and Don Pasquale . Following the bel canto era, a more direct, forceful style was rapidly popularised by Giuseppe Verdi , beginning with his biblical opera Nabucco . This opera, and the ones that would follow in Verdi's career, revolutionised Italian opera, changing it from merely a display of vocal fireworks, with Rossini's and Donizetti's works, to dramatic story-telling. Verdi's operas resonated with the growing spirit of Italian nationalism in the post- Napoleonic era, and he quickly became an icon of the patriotic movement for a unified Italy.

In it, Verdi blurs the distinction between the aria and recitative as it never before was, leading the opera to be \"an unending string of duets\". La traviata was also novel. It tells the story of courtesan, and it includes elements of verismo or \"realistic\" opera, [ 16 ] because rather than featuring great kings and figures from literature, it focuses on the tragedies of ordinary life and society. After these, he continued to develop his style, composing perhaps the greatest French grand opera , Don Carlos , and ending his career with two Shakespeare-inspired works, Otello and Falstaff , which reveal how far Italian opera had grown in sophistication since the early 19th century. These final two works showed Verdi at his most masterfully orchestrated, and are both incredibly influential, and modern. In Falstaff , Verdi sets the pre-eminent standard for the form and style that would dominate opera throughout the twentieth century. Rather than long, suspended melodies, Falstaff contains many little motifs and mottos, that, rather than being expanded upon, are introduced and subsequently dropped, only to be brought up again later. These motifs never are expanded upon, and just as the audience expects a character to launch into a long melody, a new character speaks, introducing a new phrase. This fashion of opera directed opera from Verdi, onward, exercising tremendous influence on his successors Giacomo Puccini , Richard Strauss , and Benjamin Britten .

This was a style introduced by Pietro Mascagni 's Cavalleria rusticana and Ruggero Leoncavallo 's Pagliacci that came to dominate the world's opera stages with such popular works as Giacomo Puccini 's La bohème , Tosca , and Madama Butterfly . Later Italian composers, such as Berio and Nono , have experimented with modernism . [ 18 ] The first German opera was Dafne , composed by Heinrich Schütz in 1627, but the music score has not survived. Italian opera held a great sway over German-speaking countries until the late 18th century. Nevertheless, native forms would develop in spite of this influence. In 1644, Sigmund Staden produced the first Singspiel , Seelewig , a popular form of German-language opera in which singing alternates with spoken dialogue. In the late 17th century and early 18th century, the Theater am Gänsemarkt in Hamburg presented German operas by Keiser , Telemann and Handel . Yet most of the major German composers of the time, including Handel himself, as well as Graun , Hasse and later Gluck , chose to write most of their operas in foreign languages, especially Italian. In contrast to Italian opera, which was generally composed for the aristocratic class, German opera was generally composed for the masses and tended to feature simple folk-like melodies, and it was not until the arrival of Mozart that German opera was able to match its Italian counterpart in musical sophistication.

[ 20 ] [ 21 ] Mozart 's Singspiele , Die Entführung aus dem Serail (1782) and Die Zauberflöte (1791) were an important breakthrough in achieving international recognition for German opera. The tradition was developed in the 19th century by Beethoven with his Fidelio (1805), inspired by the climate of the French Revolution . Carl Maria von Weber established German Romantic opera in opposition to the dominance of Italian bel canto . His Der Freischütz (1821) shows his genius for creating a supernatural atmosphere. Other opera composers of the time include Marschner , Schubert and Lortzing , but the most significant figure was undoubtedly Wagner . Wagner was one of the most revolutionary and controversial composers in musical history. Starting under the influence of Weber and Meyerbeer , he gradually evolved a new concept of opera as a Gesamtkunstwerk (a \"complete work of art\"), a fusion of music, poetry and painting. He greatly increased the role and power of the orchestra, creating scores with a complex web of leitmotifs , recurring themes often associated with the characters and concepts of the drama, of which prototypes can be heard in his earlier operas such as Der fliegende Holländer , Tannhäuser and Lohengrin ; and he was prepared to violate accepted musical conventions, such as tonality , in his quest for greater expressivity.

In his mature music dramas, Tristan und Isolde , Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg , Der Ring des Nibelungen and Parsifal , he abolished the distinction between aria and recitative in favour of a seamless flow of \"endless melody\". Wagner also brought a new philosophical dimension to opera in his works, which were usually based on stories from Germanic or Arthurian legend. Finally, Wagner built his own opera house at Bayreuth with part of the patronage from Ludwig II of Bavaria , exclusively dedicated to performing his own works in the style he wanted. Opera would never be the same after Wagner and for many composers his legacy proved a heavy burden. On the other hand, Richard Strauss accepted Wagnerian ideas but took them in wholly new directions, along with incorporating the new form introduced by Verdi. He first won fame with the scandalous Salome and the dark tragedy Elektra , in which tonality was pushed to the limits. Then Strauss changed tack in his greatest success, Der Rosenkavalier , where Mozart and Viennese waltzes became as important an influence as Wagner. Strauss continued to produce a highly varied body of operatic works, often with libretti by the poet Hugo von Hofmannsthal . Other composers who made individual contributions to German opera in the early 20th century include Alexander von Zemlinsky , Erich Korngold , Franz Schreker , Paul Hindemith , Kurt Weill and the Italian-born Ferruccio Busoni .

[ 3 ] Literature is a method of recording, preserving, and transmitting knowledge and entertainment . It can also have a social, psychological, spiritual, or political role. Literary criticism is one of the oldest academic disciplines, and is concerned with the literary merit or intellectual significance of specific texts.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] Literature is often referred to synecdochically as \"writing,\" especially creative writing , and poetically as \"the craft of writing\" (or simply \"the craft\"). Syd Field described his discipline, screenwriting , as \"a craft that occasionally rises to the level of art.\" [ 12 ] A value judgment definition of literature considers it as consisting solely of high quality writing that forms part of the belles-lettres (\"fine writing\") tradition. [ 13 ] An example of this is in the 1910–1911 Encyclopædia Britannica , which classified literature as \"the best expression of the best thought reduced to writing\". [ 14 ] The use of the term \"literature\" here poses some issues due to its origins in the Latin littera , \"letter,\" essentially writing.

Oral storytelling traditions flourished in a context without the use of writing to record and preserve history, scientific knowledge, and social practices. [ 27 ] While some stories were told for amusement and leisure, most functioned as practical lessons from tribal experience applied to immediate moral, social, psychological, and environmental issues. [ 28 ] Stories fuse fictional, supernatural, or otherwise exaggerated characters and circumstances with real emotions and morals as a means of teaching. Plots often reflect real life situations and may be aimed at particular people known by the story's audience. In this way, social pressure could be exerted without directly causing embarrassment or social exclusion .

[ 32 ] [ note 1 ] Around the 4th millennium BC, the complexity of trade and administration in Mesopotamia outgrew human memory, and writing became a more dependable method of recording and presenting transactions in a permanent form. [ 34 ] Though in both ancient Egypt and Mesoamerica , writing may have already emerged because of the need to record historical and environmental events. Subsequent innovations included more uniform, predictable legal systems , sacred texts , and the origins of modern practices of scientific inquiry and knowledge-consolidation , all largely reliant on portable and easily reproducible forms of writing. Ancient Egyptian literature , [ 35 ] along with Sumerian literature , are considered the world's oldest literatures .

In the nineteenth century some notable individuals include Emily Brontë , Elizabeth Barrett Browning , and Emily Dickinson (see American poetry ). But while generally women are absent from the European canon of Romantic literature , there is one notable exception, the French novelist and memoirist Amantine Dupin (1804 – 1876) best known by her pen name George Sand . [ 82 ] [ 83 ] One of the more popular writers in Europe in her lifetime, [ 84 ] being more renowned than both Victor Hugo and Honoré de Balzac in England in the 1830s and 1840s, [ 85 ] Sand is recognised as one of the most notable writers of the European Romantic era.

    "text": "A cuisine is a style of cooking characterized by distinctive ingredients , techniques , and dishes , and usually associated with a specific culture or geographic region. Regional food preparation techniques, customs and ingredients combine to enable dishes unique to a region. [ 1 ] Used in English since the late 18th century, the word cuisine—meaning manner or style of cooking—is borrowed from the French for 'style of cooking' (literally 'kitchen'), as originally derived from Latin coquere , 'to cook'. [ 2 ] A cuisine is partly determined by ingredients that are available locally or through trade. Regional ingredients are developed and commonly contribute to a regional or national cuisine, such as Japanese rice in Japanese cuisine . Religious food laws can also exercise an influence on cuisine, such as Indian cuisine and Hinduism that is mainly lacto-vegetarian (avoiding meat and eggs) due to sacred animal worship. Sikhism in Punjabi cuisine , Buddhism in East Asian cuisine , Christianity in European cuisine , [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Islam in Middle Eastern cuisine , and Judaism in Jewish and Israeli cuisine all exercise an influence on cuisine. Some factors that have an influence on a region's cuisine include the area's climate , the trade among different countries, religious or sumptuary laws and culinary culture exchange. For example, a tropical diet may be based more on fruits and vegetables, while a polar diet might rely more on meat and fish. The area's climate, in large measure, determines the native foods that are available. In addition, climate influences food preservation. For example, foods preserved for winter consumption by smoking , curing and pickling have remained significant in world cuisines for their altered gustatory properties.

The trade among different countries also largely affects a region's cuisine. Dating back to the ancient spice trade, seasonings such as cinnamon , cassia , cardamom , ginger and turmeric were important items of commerce in the earliest evolution of trade, and India was a global market for this. Cinnamon and cassia found their way to the Middle East at least 4,000 years ago. [ 6 ] Certain foods and food preparations are required or proscribed by the religiousness or sumptuary laws, such as Islamic dietary laws and Jewish dietary laws. Culinary culture exchange is also an important factor for cuisine in many regions: Japan's first substantial and direct exposure to the West came with the arrival of European missionaries in the second half of the 16th century. At that time, the combination of Spanish and Portuguese game frying techniques with an East Asian method for cooking vegetables in oil, led to the development of tempura , the \"popular Japanese dish in which seafood and many different types of vegetables are coated with batter and deep fried\". [ 7 ] Cuisine dates back to classical antiquity . As food began to require more planning, there was an emergence of meals that situated around culture. [ 8 ] Cuisines evolve continually, and new cuisines are created by innovation and cultural interaction. One recent example is fusion cuisine , which combines elements of various culinary traditions while not being categorized per any one cuisine style, and generally refers to the innovations in many contemporary restaurant cuisines since the 1970s.

[ 10 ] Molecular cuisine is a modern style of cooking which takes advantage of many technical innovations from the scientific disciplines (molecular cooking). The term was coined in 1999 by the French INRA chemist Hervé This because he wanted to distinguish it from the name Molecular gastronomy (a scientific activity) that was introduced by him and the late Oxford physicist Nicholas Kurti in 1988. [ 11 ] It is also named as multi sensory cooking, modernist cuisine, culinary physics and experimental cuisine by some chefs.

Regional cuisines can vary based on availability and usage of specific ingredients, local cooking traditions and practices, as well as overall cultural differences. [ 14 ] Such factors can be more-or-less uniform across wide swaths of territory, or vary intensely within individual regions. For example, in Central and North South America, corn (maize), both fresh and dried, is a staple food, and is used in many different ways. In northern Europe, wheat, rye and fats of animal origin predominate, while in southern Europe olive oil is ubiquitous and rice is more prevalent. In Italy, the cuisine of the north, featuring butter and rice, stands in contrast to that of the south, with its wheat pasta and olive oil. In some parts of Greece, gyros is the staple, while in others this role is filled by bread. Throughout the Middle East and Mediterranean, common ingredients include lamb , olive oil, lemons, peppers and rice. The vegetarianism practiced in much of India has made pulses (crops harvested solely for the dry seed) such as chickpeas and lentils as important as wheat or rice. From India to Indonesia, the extensive use of spices is characteristic; coconuts and seafood are also used throughout the region both as foodstuffs and as seasonings .

Ingredients common to East Asia and Southeast Asia (due to overseas Chinese influence) include rice, ginger, garlic, sesame seeds, chilies, dried onions, soy and tofu, with stir frying , steaming and deep frying being common cooking methods. While rice is common to most regional cuisines in Asia, different varieties are popular in the different regions: Basmati rice is popular in South Asia, Jasmine rice in Southeast Asia, and long-grain rice in China and short-grain rice in Japan and Korea.

It is often marked as a local or national holiday , mela , or Eid . A festival constitutes typical cases of glocalization , as well as the high culture-low culture interrelationship. [ 2 ] Next to religion and folklore , a significant origin is agricultural . Food is such a vital resource that many festivals are associated with harvest time. Religious commemoration and thanksgiving for good harvests are blended in events that take place in autumn , such as Halloween in the northern hemisphere and Easter in the southern. Festivals often serve to fulfill specific communal purposes, especially in regard to commemoration or thanking to the gods, goddesses or saints: they are called patronal festivals . They may also provide entertainment , which was particularly important to local communities before the advent of mass-produced entertainment. Festivals that focus on cultural or ethnic topics also seek to inform community members of their traditions ; the involvement of elders sharing stories and experience provides a means for unity among families .

Traditions can persist and evolve for thousands of year. The word tradition itself derives from the Latin word tradere literally meaning to transmit, to hand over, to give for safekeeping. While it is reportedly assumed that traditions have an ancient history, many traditions have been invented on purpose, whether it be political or cultural, over short periods of time. Various academic disciplines also use the word in a variety of ways. The phrase \"according to tradition\" or \"by tradition\" usually means that what follows is known only through oral tradition and is not supported (and might even be refuted) by solid evidence.

The conceptualization of tradition, as the notion of holding on to a previous time, is also found in political and philosophical discourse. For example, it is the basis of the political concept of traditionalism , and also strands of many world religions including traditional Catholicism . In artistic contexts, tradition is used to decide the correct display of an art form . For example, in the performance of traditional genres (such as traditional dance), adherence to guidelines dictating how an art form should be composed are given greater importance than the performer's own preferences. A host of factors can exacerbate the loss of tradition , including industrialization , globalization , and the assimilation or marginalization of specific cultural groups. In response to this, tradition-preservation attempts and initiatives have now been started in many countries around the world, focusing on aspects such as traditional languages . Tradition is usually contrasted with the goal of modernity and should be differentiated from customs, conventions, laws , norms , routines, rules and similar concepts. The English word tradition comes from the Latin traditio via French , the noun from the verb tradere (to transmit, to hand over, to give for safekeeping); it was originally used in Roman law to refer to the concept of legal transfers and inheritance .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Tradition can also refer to beliefs or customs that are prehistoric , with lost or arcane origins, existing from time immemorial . [ 9 ] Originally, traditions were passed orally, without the need for a writing system . Tools to aid this process include poetic devices such as rhyme , epic stories and alliteration . The stories thus preserved are also referred to as tradition, or as part of an oral tradition . Even such traditions, however, are presumed to have originated (been \"invented\" by humans) at some point. [ 2 ] [ 4 ] Traditions are often presumed to be ancient , unalterable, and deeply important, though they may sometimes be much less \"natural\" than is presumed.

[ 20 ] A tradition may be deliberately created and promulgated for personal, commercial, political, or national self-interest , as was done in colonial Africa; or it may be adopted rapidly based on a single highly publicized event, rather than developing and spreading organically in a population, as in the case of the white wedding dress , which only became popular after Queen Victoria wore a white gown at her wedding to Albert of Saxe-Coburg . [ 21 ] An example of an invention of tradition is the rebuilding of the Palace of Westminster (location of the British Parliament ) in the Gothic style .

Often these inventions were based in some form of tradition, but were exaggerated, distorted, or biased toward a particular interpretation. Invented traditions are central components of modern national cultures, providing a commonality of experience and promoting the unified national identity espoused by nationalism . [ 23 ] Common examples include public holidays (particularly those unique to a particular nation), the singing of national anthems, and traditional national cuisine (see national dish ). Expatriate and immigrant communities may continue to practice the national traditions of their home nation. In science, tradition is often used in the literature in order to define the relationship of an author's thoughts to that of his or her field. [ 24 ] In 1948, philosopher of science Karl Popper suggested that there should be a \"rational theory of tradition\" applied to science which was fundamentally sociological. For Popper, each scientist who embarks on a certain research trend inherits the tradition of the scientists before them as he or she inherits their studies and any conclusions that superseded it. [ 24 ] Unlike myth , which is a means of explaining the natural world through means other than logical criticism, scientific tradition was inherited from Socrates, who proposed critical discussion, according to Popper.

It is also used in varying contexts in other fields, such as history, psychology and sociology . Social scientists and others have worked to refine the commonsense concept of tradition to make it into a useful concept for scholarly analysis. In the 1970s and 1980s, Edward Shils explored the concept in detail. [ 18 ] Since then, a wide variety of social scientists have criticized traditional ideas about tradition; meanwhile, \"tradition\" has come into usage in biology as applied to nonhuman animals. Tradition as a concept variously defined in different disciplines should not be confused with various traditions (perspectives, approaches) in those disciplines. [ 26 ] Tradition is one of the key concepts in anthropology; it can be said that anthropology is the study of \"tradition in traditional societies\". [ 8 ] There is however no \"theory of tradition\", as for most anthropologists the need to discuss what tradition is seems unnecessary, as defining tradition is both unnecessary (everyone can be expected to know what it is) and unimportant (as small differences in definition would be just technical).

The term is especially common in the study of American archaeology . [ 18 ] Biologists, when examining groups of non-humans, have observed repeated behaviors which are taught within communities from one generation to the next. Tradition is defined in biology as \"a behavioral practice that is relatively enduring (i.e., is performed repeatedly over a period of time), that is shared among two or more members of a group, that depends in part on socially aided learning for its generation in new practitioners\", and has been called a precursor to \"culture\" in the anthropological sense. [ 27 ] Behavioral traditions have been observed in groups of fish, birds, and mammals. Groups of orangutans and chimpanzees, in particular, may display large numbers of behavioral traditions, and in chimpanzees, transfer of traditional behavior from one group to another (not just within a group) has been observed. Such behavioral traditions may have evolutionary significance, allowing adaptation at a faster rate than genetic change. [ 28 ] In the field of musicology and ethnomusicology tradition refers to the belief systems, repertoire, techniques, style and culture that is passed down through subsequent generations. Tradition in music suggests a historical context with which one can perceive distinguishable patterns.

'Tradition, or traditions, can be presented as a context in which to study the work of a specific composer or as a part of a wide-ranging historical perspective.' [ 30 ] The concept of tradition, in early sociological research (around the turn of the 19th and 20th century), referred to that of the traditional society , as contrasted by the more modern industrial society . [ 13 ] This approach was most notably portrayed in Max Weber 's concepts of traditional authority and modern rational-legal authority . [ 13 ] In more modern works, One hundred years later, sociology sees tradition as a social construct used to contrast past with the present and as a form of rationality used to justify certain course of action. [ 13 ] Traditional society is characterized by lack of distinction between family and business, division of labor influenced primarily by age, gender, and status, high position of custom in the system of values, self-sufficiency, preference to saving and accumulation of capital instead of productive investment, relative autarky .

[ 13 ] Another important sociological aspect of tradition is the one that relates to rationality. It is also related to the works of Max Weber (see theories of rationality ), and were popularized and redefined in 1992 by Raymond Boudon in his book Action . [ 13 ] In this context tradition refers to the mode of thinking and action justified as \"it has always been that way\". [ 13 ] This line of reasoning forms the basis of the logical flaw of the appeal to tradition (or argumentum ad antiquitatem ), [ 31 ] which takes the form \"this is right because we've always done it this way.\" [ 32 ] In most cases such an appeal can be refuted on the grounds that the \"tradition\" being advocated may no longer be desirable, or, indeed, may never have been despite its previous popularity. The idea of tradition is important in philosophy. Twentieth century philosophy is often divided between an 'analytic' tradition, dominant in Anglophone and Scandinavian countries, and a 'continental' tradition, dominant in German and Romance speaking Europe. Increasingly central to continental philosophy is the project of deconstructing what its proponents, following Martin Heidegger , call 'the tradition', which began with Plato and Aristotle . In contrast, some continental philosophers - most notably, Hans-Georg Gadamer - have attempted to rehabilitate the tradition of Aristotelianism .

The concepts of tradition and traditional values are frequently used in political and religious discourse to establish the legitimacy of a particular set of values. In the United States in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, the concept of tradition has been used to argue for the centrality and legitimacy of conservative religious values. [ 33 ] Similarly, strands of orthodox theological thought from a number of world religions openly identify themselves as wanting a return to tradition, although \"tradition\" or its plural can also refer simply to the core teaching of religious group: thus Paul in 1 Corinthians 11 :2 refers to \"the traditions, even as I delivered them to you\". [ 34 ] In contrast to the Protestant Christian doctrine of \"scripture alone\" (Latin: Sola scriptura ), Catholic theological doctrine sees \"tradition\" alongside \"scripture\" as sources of authority: Sacred tradition , therefore, and Sacred Scripture of both the Old and New Testaments, are like a mirror in which the pilgrim Church on earth looks at God. [ 35 ] The term \" traditionalist Catholic \" refers to those, such as Archbishop Lefebvre , who want the worship and practices of the Church to be as they were before the Second Vatican Council of 1962–65.

More generally, tradition has been used as a way of determining the political spectrum , with right-wing parties having a stronger affinity to certain ways of the past than left-wing ones. [ 37 ] Here, the concept of adherence tradition is embodied by the political philosophy of traditionalist conservatism (or simply traditionalism ), which emphasizes the need for the principles of natural law and transcendent moral order, hierarchy and organic unity , agrarianism , classicism and high culture , and the intersecting spheres of loyalty. [ 38 ] Traditionalists would therefore reject the notions of individualism , liberalism, modernity, and social progress , but promote cultural and educational renewal, [ 39 ] and revive interest in the Church, the family, the State and local community. This view has been criticised for including in its notion of tradition practices which are no longer considered to be desirable, for example, stereotypical views of the place of women in domestic affairs . [ 40 ] In other societies, especially ones experiencing rapid social change, the idea of what is \"traditional\" may be widely contested, with different groups striving to establish their own values as the legitimate traditional ones. Defining and enacting traditions in some cases can be the means of building unity between subgroups in a diverse society; in other cases, tradition is a means of othering and keeping groups distinct from one another.

[ 1 ] It is often the unchanging form of certain arts that leads to their perception as traditional. [ 1 ] For artistic endeavors, tradition has been used as a contrast to creativity , with traditional and folk art associated with unoriginal imitation or repetition, in contrast to fine art , which is valued for being original and unique. More recent philosophy of art , however, considers interaction with tradition as integral to the development of new artistic expression.

This dichotomy is generally associated with a linear model of social change, in which societies progress from being traditional to being modern.

    "text": "Philosophy of culture is a branch of philosophy that examines the essence and meaning of culture . It focuses on how human creativity, rationality, and collective experiences shape cultural identities. It traces the development of cultural thought from early modern discussions on national identity and Enlightenment ideals, through German and English Romanticism , to more scientific approaches. The German philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) has formulated an individualist definition of \"enlightenment\" similar to the concept of bildung : \"Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-incurred immaturity.\" [ 1 ] He argued that this immaturity comes not from a lack of understanding, but from a lack of courage to think independently. Against this intellectual cowardice, Kant urged: Sapere aude , \"Dare to be wise!\" In reaction to Kant, German scholars such as Johann Gottfried Herder (1744–1803) argued that human creativity , which necessarily takes unpredictable and highly diverse forms, is as important as human rationality. Moreover, Herder proposed a collective form of bildung : \"For Herder, Bildung was the totality of experiences that provide a coherent identity, and sense of common destiny, to a people.\" [ 2 ] In 1795, the linguist and philosopher Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767–1835) called for an anthropology that would synthesize Kant's and Herder's interests. During the Romantic era , scholars in Germany , especially those concerned with nationalist movements—such as the nationalist struggle to create a \"Germany\" out of diverse principalities, and the nationalist struggles by ethnic minorities against the Austro-Hungarian Empire —developed a more inclusive notion of culture as \" worldview \"( Weltanschauung ). According to this school of thought, each ethnic group has a distinct worldview that is incommensurable with the worldviews of other groups. Although more inclusive than earlier views, this approach to culture still allowed for distinctions between \"civilized\" and \"primitive\" or \"tribal\""

Although more inclusive than earlier views, this approach to culture still allowed for distinctions between \"civilized\" and \"primitive\" or \"tribal\" cultures. In 1860, Adolf Bastian (1826–1905) argued for \"the psychic unity of mankind\". He proposed that a scientific comparison of all human societies would reveal that distinct worldviews consisted of the same basic elements. According to Bastian, all human societies share a set of \"elementary ideas\" ( Elementargedanken ); different cultures, or different \"folk ideas\" ( Völkergedanken ), are local modifications of the elementary ideas. [ 3 ] This view paved the way for the modern understanding of culture. Franz Boas (1858–1942) was trained in this tradition, and he brought it with him when he left Germany for the United States. In the 19th century, humanists such as English poet and essayist Matthew Arnold (1822–1888) used the word \"culture\" to refer to an ideal of individual human refinement, of \"the best that has been thought and said in the world.\" [ 4 ] This concept of culture is comparable to the German concept of bildung : \"...culture being a pursuit of our total perfection by means of getting to know, on all the matters which most concern us, the best which has been thought and said in the world.\" [ 4 ] In practice, culture referred to an élite ideal and was associated with such activities as art , classical music , and haute cuisine .

This distinction is often characterized as that between high culture , namely that of the ruling social group , and low culture . In other words, the idea of \"culture\" that developed in Europe during the 18th and early 19th centuries reflected inequalities within European societies. [ 6 ] Matthew Arnold contrasted \"culture\" with anarchy ; other Europeans, following philosophers Thomas Hobbes and Jean-Jacques Rousseau , contrasted \"culture\" with \"the state of nature\". According to Hobbes and Rousseau, the Native Americans who were being conquered by Europeans from the 16th centuries on were living in a state of nature; this opposition was expressed through the contrast between \"civilized\" and \"uncivilized.\" According to this way of thinking, one could classify some countries and nations as more civilized than others and some people as more cultured than others. This contrast led to Herbert Spencer 's theory of Social Darwinism and Lewis Henry Morgan 's theory of cultural evolution . Just as some critics have argued that the distinction between high and low cultures is really an expression of the conflict between European elites and non-elites, some critics have argued that the distinction between civilized and uncivilized people is really an expression of the conflict between European colonial powers and their colonial subjects.

These critics considered folk music (as produced by \"the folk\", i.e., rural, illiterate, peasants) to honestly express a natural way of life, while classical music seemed superficial and decadent. Equally, this view often portrayed indigenous peoples as \" noble savages \" living authentic and unblemished lives, uncomplicated and uncorrupted by the highly stratified capitalist systems of the West . In 1870 the anthropologist Edward Tylor (1832–1917) applied these ideas of higher versus lower culture to propose a theory of the evolution of religion . According to this theory, religion evolves from more polytheistic to more monotheistic forms. [ 7 ] In the process, he redefined culture as a diverse set of activities characteristic of all human societies. This view paved the way for the modern understanding of culture."

Therefore, popular culture exerts a significant influence on an individual's attitudes towards certain topics. [ 4 ] However, there are various ways to define pop culture. [ 5 ] Because of this, popular culture is something that can be defined in a variety of conflicting ways by different people across different contexts. [ 6 ] It is generally viewed in contrast to other forms of culture , such as folk culture , working-class culture , or high culture , and also from different academic perspectives, including psychoanalysis , structuralism , postmodernism , and more. The common pop-culture categories are entertainment (e.g., film , music , television , literature and video games ), sports , news (as in people / places in the news), politics , fashion , technology , and slang .

Reading also gained traction. Labeling penny dreadfuls the Victorian equivalent of video games, The Guardian in 2016 described penny fiction as \"Britain's first taste of mass-produced popular culture for the young\". [ 13 ] A growing consumer culture and an increased capacity for travel via the newly invented railway (the first public railway, Stockton and Darlington Railway , opened in north-east England in 1825) created both a market for cheap popular literature and the ability for its distribution on a large scale.

A postmodernist approach to popular culture would \"no longer recognize the distinction between high and popular culture\". Storey claims that popular culture emerged from the urbanization of the Industrial Revolution . Studies of Shakespeare (by Weimann, Barber, or Bristol, for example) locate much of the characteristic vitality of his drama in its participation in Renaissance popular culture, while contemporary practitioners like Dario Fo and John McGrath use popular culture in its Gramscian sense that includes ancient folk traditions (the commedia dell'arte for example).

Within the realm of popular culture, there exists an organizational culture. From its beginning, popular culture has revolved around classes in society and the push-back between them. Within popular culture, there are two levels that have emerged, high and low. High culture can be described as art and works considered of superior value, historically, aesthetically and socially. Low culture is regarded by some as that of the lower classes, historically. [ 26 ] Adaptations based on traditional folklore provide a source of popular culture. [ 27 ] This early layer of cultural mainstream still persists today, in a form separate from mass-produced popular culture, propagating by word of mouth rather than via mass media, e.g. in the form of jokes or urban legends .

This system, critics argue, is designed to privilege products selected and mass-marketed by capitalists. Such criticisms find articulation in the works of Marxist theorists—including luminaries like Herbert Marcuse , Theodor Adorno , Max Horkheimer , bell hooks , Antonio Gramsci , Guy Debord , Fredric Jameson , Terry Eagleton —as well as postmodern philosophers such as Jean-François Lyotard (who dissected the commercialization of information under capitalism). [ 28 ] The Frankfurt School, particularly Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer , delivered critiques through their concept of the \"culture industry,\" explored in their seminal Dialectic of Enlightenment . Drawing from Kant , Marx , Nietzsche , and others, they argued that capitalist popular culture is far from an authentic expression of the people. Instead, it constitutes a system churning out homogenous, standardized products, manufactured to serve the interests of elite domination. Consumer desire for Hollywood films , pop melodies, and disposable bestsellers is not organic, but shaped by the capitalist behemoths—Hollywood studios, record labels, publishing giants—and the elite gatekeepers who dictate which commodities saturate our media, from television screens to print journalism.

[ 32 ] The success of phenomena like the Harry Potter franchise , as critiqued by Jack Zipes , exemplifies this mass commercialization and corporate hegemony. Zipes contends that culture industry commodities achieve \"popularity\" precisely through their homogeneity and adherence to formula. The media, he argues, actively molds children's tastes. [ 33 ] Postmodern sociologist Jean Baudrillard presented a stark view of the consumer's role. He argued that individuals are relentlessly conditioned to pursue the maximization of pleasure as a social duty – a failure to participate risks rendering one asocial . [ 34 ] His core critique held that products of capitalist culture, especially those marketed as rebellious, can only offer an illusion of defiance. True rebellion is impossible because the system producing these commodities remains firmly controlled by the powerful.

The impact of films and cinema are most evident when analyzing in the search of what the films aim to portray. [ 50 ] Films are used to seek acceptance and understanding of many subjects because of the influence the films carry—an example of an early representation of this can be seen in Casablanca (1942): the film introduced war subjects to the public after the United States entered World War II, and it meant to increase pro-war sentiment for the allies."

It is in contrast to social anthropology , which perceives cultural variation as a subset of a posited anthropological constant. The term sociocultural anthropology includes both cultural and social anthropology traditions. [ 1 ] Anthropologists have pointed out that through culture, people can adapt to their environment in non-genetic ways, so people living in different environments will often have different cultures. Much of anthropological theory has originated in an appreciation of and interest in the tension between the local (particular cultures) and the global (a universal human nature, or the web of connections between people in distinct places/circumstances). [ 2 ] Cultural anthropology has a rich methodology , including participant observation (often called fieldwork because it requires the anthropologist spending an extended period of time at the research location), interviews , and surveys . [ 3 ] Modern anthropology emerged in the 19th century, coinciding with significant developments in the Western world. These changes sparked a renewed interest in understanding humankind, particularly, its origins, unity, and plurality. However, it was in the early 20th century that cultural anthropology began to adopt a more pluralistic perspective on cultures and societies. [ 4 ] The term itself was coined by the Boas circle , who advanced the key theoretical frameworks of cultural relativism and historical particularism . [ 5 ] Cultural anthropology emerged in the late 19th century, shaped by debates over what constituted \"primitive\" versus \"civilized\" societies, an issue that preoccupied not only Freud , but many of his contemporaries.

[ 6 ] The first generation of cultural anthropologists were interested in the relative status of various humans, some of whom had modern advanced technologies, while others lacked anything but face-to-face communication techniques and still lived a Paleolithic lifestyle. One of the earliest articulations of the anthropological meaning of the term \" culture \" came from Sir Edward Tylor : \"Culture, or civilization, taken in its broad, ethnographic sense, is that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.\" [ 7 ] The term \"civilization\" later gave way to definitions given by V. Gordon Childe , with culture forming an umbrella term and civilization becoming a particular kind of culture. [ 8 ] Kay Milton, former Director of Anthropology Research at Queen's University Belfast, distinguishes between general and specific cultures. This means culture can be something applied to all human beings or it can be specific to a certain group of people such as African American culture or Irish American culture. Specific cultures are structured systems which means they are organized very specifically and adding or taking away any element from that system may disrupt it. [ 9 ] Anthropology is concerned with the lives of people in different parts of the world, particularly in relation to the discourse of beliefs and practices.

Other ethnologists argued that different groups had the capability of creating similar beliefs and practices independently. Some of those who advocated \"independent invention\", like Lewis Henry Morgan , additionally supposed that similarities meant that different groups had passed through the same stages of cultural evolution (See also classical social evolutionism ). Morgan, in particular, acknowledged that certain forms of society and culture could not possibly have arisen before others. For example, industrial farming could not have been invented before simple farming, and metallurgy could not have developed without previous non-smelting processes involving metals (such as simple ground collection or mining). Morgan, like other 19th century social evolutionists, believed there was a more or less orderly progression from the primitive to the civilized. 20th-century anthropologists largely reject the notion that all human societies must pass through the same stages in the same order, on the grounds that such a notion does not fit the empirical facts. Some 20th-century ethnologists, like Julian Steward , have instead argued that such similarities reflected similar adaptations to similar environments. Although 19th-century ethnologists saw \"diffusion\" and \"independent invention\" as mutually exclusive and competing theories, most ethnographers quickly reached a consensus that both processes occur, and that both can plausibly account for cross-cultural similarities. But these ethnographers also pointed out the superficiality of many such similarities. They noted that even traits that spread through diffusion often were given different meanings and function from one society to another."

Analyses of large human concentrations in big cities, in multidisciplinary studies by Ronald Daus , show how new methods may be applied to the understanding of man living in a global world and how it was caused by the action of extra-European nations, so highlighting the role of Ethics in modern anthropology. Accordingly, most of these anthropologists showed less interest in comparing cultures, generalizing about human nature, or discovering universal laws of cultural development, than in understanding particular cultures in those cultures' own terms. Such ethnographers and their students promoted the idea of \" cultural relativism \", the view that one can only understand another person's beliefs and behaviors in the context of the culture in which they live or lived. Others, such as Claude Lévi-Strauss (who was influenced both by American cultural anthropology and by French Durkheimian sociology ), have argued that apparently similar patterns of development reflect fundamental similarities in the structure of human thought (see structuralism ). By the mid-20th century, the number of examples of people skipping stages, such as going from hunter-gatherers to post-industrial service occupations in one generation, were so numerous that 19th-century evolutionism was effectively disproved. [ 10 ] Cultural relativism is a principle that was established as axiomatic in anthropological research by Franz Boas and later popularized by his students.

Boas argued that cultural development is not determined by genetic ancestry. [ 12 ] Cultural relativism involves specific epistemological and methodological claims. Whether or not these claims require a specific ethical stance is a matter of debate. This principle should not be confused with moral relativism . Cultural relativism was in part a response to Western ethnocentrism . Ethnocentrism may take obvious forms, in which one consciously believes that one's people's arts are the most beautiful, values the most virtuous, and beliefs the most truthful. Boas, originally trained in physics and geography , and heavily influenced by the thought of Kant , Herder , and von Humboldt , argued that one's culture may mediate and thus limit one's perceptions in less obvious ways. This understanding of culture confronts anthropologists with two problems: first, how to escape the unconscious bonds of one's own culture, which inevitably bias our perceptions of and reactions to the world, and second, how to make sense of an unfamiliar culture. The principle of cultural relativism thus forced anthropologists to develop innovative methods and heuristic strategies. [ citation needed ] Boas and his students realized that if they were to conduct scientific research in other cultures, they would need to employ methods that avoid the limits of researcher ethnocentrism.

[ citation needed ] Boas and his students realized that if they were to conduct scientific research in other cultures, they would need to employ methods that avoid the limits of researcher ethnocentrism. One such method is that of ethnography . This method advocates living with people of another culture for an extended period of time to learn the local language and be enculturated, at least partially, into that culture. In this context, cultural relativism is of fundamental methodological importance, because it calls attention to the importance of the local context in understanding the meaning of particular human beliefs and activities. Thus, in 1948 Virginia Heyer wrote, \"Cultural relativity, to phrase it in starkest abstraction, states the relativity of the part to the whole. The part gains its cultural significance by its place in the whole, and cannot retain its integrity in a different situation.\" [ 13 ] The rubric cultural anthropology is generally applied to ethnographic works that are holistic in approach, are oriented to the ways in which culture affects individual experience or aim to provide a rounded view of the knowledge, customs, and institutions of a people. Social anthropology is a term applied to ethnographic works that attempt to isolate a particular system of social relations such as those that comprise domestic life, economy, law, politics, or religion, give analytical priority to the organizational bases of social life, and attend to cultural phenomena as somewhat secondary to the main issues of social scientific inquiry.

[ 15 ] Lewis Henry Morgan (1818–1881), a lawyer from Rochester , New York , became an advocate for and ethnological scholar of the Iroquois . His comparative analyses of religion, government, material culture, and especially kinship patterns proved to be influential contributions to the field of anthropology. Like other scholars of his day (such as Edward Tylor ), Morgan argued that human societies could be classified into categories of cultural evolution on a scale of progression that ranged from savagery , to barbarism , to civilization . Generally, Morgan used technology (such as bowmaking or pottery) as an indicator of position on this scale. Franz Boas (1858–1942) established academic anthropology in the United States in opposition to Morgan's evolutionary perspective. His approach was empirical, skeptical of overgeneralizations, and eschewed attempts to establish universal laws. For example, Boas studied immigrant children to demonstrate that genetic ancestry was not imdominable, and that human conduct and behavior resulted from nurture, rather than nature. Influenced by the German tradition, Boas argued that the world was full of distinct cultures, rather than societies whose evolution could be measured by the extent of \"civilization\" they had. He believed that each culture has to be studied in its particularity, and argued that cross-cultural generalizations, like those made in the natural sciences , were not possible.

The so-called \"Four Field Approach\" has its origins in Boasian Anthropology, dividing the discipline in the four crucial and interrelated fields of sociocultural, biological, linguistic, and archaic anthropology (e.g. archaeology). Anthropology in the United States continues to be deeply influenced by the Boasian tradition, especially its emphasis on culture. Boas used his positions at Columbia University and the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) to train and develop multiple generations of students. His first generation of students included Alfred Kroeber , Robert Lowie , Edward Sapir , and Ruth Benedict , who each produced richly detailed studies of indigenous North American cultures. They provided a wealth of details used to attack the theory of a single evolutionary process. Kroeber and Sapir's focus on Native American languages helped establish linguistics as a truly general science and free it from its historical focus on Indo-European languages . The publication of Alfred Kroeber 's textbook Anthropology (1923) marked a turning point in American anthropology. After three decades of amassing material, Boasians felt a growing urge to generalize. This was most obvious in the 'Culture and Personality' studies carried out by younger Boasians such as Margaret Mead and Ruth Benedict . Influenced by psychoanalytic psychologists including Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung , these authors sought to understand the way that individual personalities were shaped by the wider cultural and social forces in which they grew up.

Boas had planned for Ruth Benedict to succeed him as chair of Columbia's anthropology department, but she was sidelined in favor of Ralph Linton , [ 17 ] and Mead was limited to her offices at the AMNH. [ 18 ] In the 1950s and mid-1960s anthropology tended increasingly to model itself after the natural sciences . Some anthropologists, such as Lloyd Fallers and Clifford Geertz , focused on processes of modernization by which newly independent states could develop. Others, such as Julian Steward and Leslie White , focused on how societies evolve and fit their ecological niche—an approach popularized by Marvin Harris . Economic anthropology as influenced by Karl Polanyi and practiced by Marshall Sahlins and George Dalton challenged standard neoclassical economics to take account of cultural and social factors and employed Marxian analysis into anthropological study. In England, British Social Anthropology's paradigm began to fragment as Max Gluckman and Peter Worsley experimented with Marxism and authors such as Rodney Needham and Edmund Leach incorporated Lévi-Strauss's structuralism into their work. Structuralism also influenced a number of developments in the 1960s and 1970s, including cognitive anthropology and componential analysis.

Since the 1980s issues of power, such as those examined in Eric Wolf 's Europe and the People Without History , have been central to the discipline. In the 1980s books like Anthropology and the Colonial Encounter pondered anthropology's ties to colonial inequality, while the immense popularity of theorists such as Antonio Gramsci and Michel Foucault moved issues of power and hegemony into the spotlight. Gender and sexuality became popular topics, as did the relationship between history and anthropology, influenced by Marshall Sahlins , who drew on Lévi-Strauss and Fernand Braudel to examine the relationship between symbolic meaning, sociocultural structure, and individual agency in the processes of historical transformation. Jean and John Comaroff produced a whole generation of anthropologists at the University of Chicago that focused on these themes. Also influential in these issues were Nietzsche , Heidegger , the critical theory of the Frankfurt School , Derrida and Lacan . [ 21 ] Many anthropologists reacted against the renewed emphasis on materialism and scientific modelling derived from Marx by emphasizing the importance of the concept of culture.

The cultural symbols of rituals, political and economic action, and of kinship, are \"read\" by the anthropologist as if they are a document in a foreign language. The interpretation of those symbols must be re-framed for their anthropological audience, i.e. transformed from the \"experience-near\" but foreign concepts of the other culture, into the \"experience-distant\" theoretical concepts of the anthropologist. These interpretations must then be reflected back to its originators, and its adequacy as a translation fine-tuned in a repeated way, a process called the hermeneutic circle . Geertz applied his method in a number of areas, creating programs of study that were very productive. His analysis of \"religion as a cultural system\" was particularly influential outside of anthropology. David Schnieder's cultural analysis of American kinship has proven equally influential. [ 23 ] Schneider demonstrated that the American folk-cultural emphasis on \"blood connections\" had an undue influence on anthropological kinship theories, and that kinship is not a biological characteristic, but a cultural relationship established on very different terms in different societies.

They were reflecting trends in research and discourse initiated by feminists in the academy, although they excused themselves from commenting specifically on those pioneering critics. [ 25 ] Nevertheless, key aspects of feminist theory and methods became de rigueur as part of the 'post-modern moment' in anthropology: Ethnographies became more interpretative and reflexive, [ 26 ] explicitly addressing the author's methodology; cultural, gendered, and racial positioning; and their influence on the ethnographic analysis. This was part of a more general trend of postmodernism that was popular contemporaneously.

Modern cultural anthropology has its origins in, and developed in reaction to, 19th century ethnology , which involves the organized comparison of human societies. Scholars like E.B. Tylor and J.G.

[ 2 ] In applying statistics to a scientific, industrial, or social problem, it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model to be studied. Populations can be diverse groups of people or objects such as \"all people living in a country\" or \"every atom composing a crystal\". Statistics deals with every aspect of data, including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments . [ 3 ] When census data (comprising every member of the target population) cannot be collected, statisticians collect data by developing specific experiment designs and survey samples . Representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can reasonably extend from the sample to the population as a whole. An experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study, manipulating the system, and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements. In contrast, an observational study does not involve experimental manipulation. Two main statistical methods are used in data analysis : descriptive statistics , which summarize data from a sample using indexes such as the mean or standard deviation , and inferential statistics , which draw conclusions from data that are subject to random variation (e.g., observational errors, sampling variation).

Inferences made using mathematical statistics employ the framework of probability theory , which deals with the analysis of random phenomena. A standard statistical procedure involves the collection of data leading to a test of the relationship between two statistical data sets, or a data set and synthetic data drawn from an idealized model. A hypothesis is proposed for the statistical relationship between the two data sets, an alternative to an idealized null hypothesis of no relationship between two data sets. Rejecting or disproving the null hypothesis is done using statistical tests that quantify the sense in which the null can be proven false, given the data that are used in the test. Working from a null hypothesis, two basic forms of error are recognized: Type I errors (null hypothesis is rejected when it is in fact true, giving a \"false positive\") and Type II errors (null hypothesis fails to be rejected when it is in fact false, giving a \"false negative\"). Multiple problems have come to be associated with this framework, ranging from obtaining a sufficient sample size to specifying an adequate null hypothesis. [ 4 ] Statistical measurement processes are also prone to error in regards to the data that they generate. Many of these errors are classified as random (noise) or systematic ( bias ), but other types of errors (e.g., blunder, such as when an analyst reports incorrect units) can also occur.

[ 5 ] Statistics is the discipline that deals with data , facts and figures with which meaningful information is inferred. Data may represent a numerical value, in form of quantitative data, or a label, as with qualitative data. Data may be collected, presented and summarised, in one of two methods called descriptive statistics. Two elementary summaries of data, singularly called a statistic, are the mean and dispersion. Whereas inferential statistics interprets data from a population sample to induce statements and predictions about a population. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 5 ] Statistics is regarded as a body of science [ 8 ] or a branch of mathematics. [ 9 ] It is based on probability, a branch of mathematics that studies random events. Statistics is considered the science of uncertainty. This arises from the ways to cope with measurement and sampling error as well as dealing with uncertanties in modelling. Although probability and statistics were once paired together as a single subject, they are conceptually distinct from one another. The former is based on deducing answers to specific situations from a general theory of probability, meanwhile statistics induces statements about a population based on a data set. Statistics serves to bridge the gap between probability and applied mathematical fields. [ 10 ]"

While many scientific investigations make use of data, statistics is generally concerned with the use of data in the context of uncertainty and decision-making in the face of uncertainty. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Statistics is indexed at 62, a subclass of probability theory and stochastic processes, in the Mathematics Subject Classification. [ 14 ] Mathematical statistics is covered in the range 276-280 of subclass QA (science > mathematics) in the Library of Congress Classification. [ 15 ] The word statistics ultimately comes from the Latin word Status, meaning \"situation\" or \"condition\" in society, which in late Latin adopted the meaning \"state\". Derived from this, political scientist Gottfried Achenwall, coined the German word statistik (a summary of how things stand). In 1770, the term entered the English language through German and referred to the study of political arrangements. The term gained its modern meaning in the 1790s in John Sinclair's works. [ 16 ] [ 17 ] In modern German, the term statistik is synonymous with mathematical statistics. The term statistic, in singular form, is used to describe a function that returns its value of the same name.

To use a sample as a guide to an entire population, it is important that it truly represents the overall population. Representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can safely extend from the sample to the population as a whole. A major problem lies in determining the extent that the sample chosen is actually representative. Statistics offers methods to estimate and correct for any bias within the sample and data collection procedures. There are also methods of experimental design that can lessen these issues at the outset of a study, strengthening its capability to discern truths about the population. Sampling theory is part of the mathematical discipline of probability theory . Probability is used in mathematical statistics to study the sampling distributions of sample statistics and, more generally, the properties of statistical procedures . The use of any statistical method is valid when the system or population under consideration satisfies the assumptions of the method. The difference in point of view between classic probability theory and sampling theory is, roughly, that probability theory starts from the given parameters of a total population to deduce probabilities that pertain to samples. Statistical inference, however, moves in the opposite direction— inductively inferring from samples to the parameters of a larger or total population.

In both types of studies, the effect of differences of an independent variable (or variables) on the behavior of the dependent variable are observed. The difference between the two types lies in how the study is actually conducted. Each can be very effective. An experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study, manipulating the system, and then taking additional measurements with different levels using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements. In contrast, an observational study does not involve experimental manipulation . Instead, data are gathered and correlations between predictors and response are investigated. While the tools of data analysis work best on data from randomized studies , they are also applied to other kinds of data—like natural experiments and observational studies [ 19 ] —for which a statistician would use a modified, more structured estimation method (e.g., difference in differences estimation and instrumental variables , among many others) that produce consistent estimators .

The researchers first measured the productivity in the plant, then modified the illumination in an area of the plant and checked if the changes in illumination affected productivity. It turned out that productivity indeed improved (under the experimental conditions). However, the study is heavily criticized today for errors in experimental procedures, specifically for the lack of a control group and blindness . The Hawthorne effect refers to finding that an outcome (in this case, worker productivity) changed due to observation itself. Those in the Hawthorne study became more productive not because the lighting was changed but because they were being observed. [ 20 ] An example of an observational study is one that explores the association between smoking and lung cancer. This type of study typically uses a survey to collect observations about the area of interest and then performs statistical analysis. In this case, the researchers would collect observations of both smokers and non-smokers, perhaps through a cohort study , and then look for the number of cases of lung cancer in each group. [ 21 ] A case-control study is another type of observational study in which people with and without the outcome of interest (e.g. lung cancer) are invited to participate and their exposure histories are collected. Various attempts have been made to produce a taxonomy of levels of measurement . The psychophysicist Stanley Smith Stevens defined nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio scales. Nominal measurements do not have meaningful rank order among values, and permit any one-to-one (injective) transformation. Ordinal measurements have imprecise differences between consecutive values, but have a meaningful order to those values, and permit any order-preserving transformation. Interval measurements"

Interval measurements have meaningful distances between measurements defined, but the zero value is arbitrary (as in the case with longitude and temperature measurements in Celsius or Fahrenheit ), and permit any linear transformation. Ratio measurements have both a meaningful zero value and the distances between different measurements defined, and permit any rescaling transformation. Because variables conforming only to nominal or ordinal measurements cannot be reasonably measured numerically, sometimes they are grouped together as categorical variables , whereas ratio and interval measurements are grouped together as quantitative variables , which can be either discrete or continuous , due to their numerical nature. Such distinctions can often be loosely correlated with data type in computer science, in that dichotomous categorical variables may be represented with the Boolean data type , polytomous categorical variables with arbitrarily assigned integers in the integral data type , and continuous variables with the real data type involving floating-point arithmetic . But the mapping of computer science data types to statistical data types depends on which categorization of the latter is being implemented. Other categorizations have been proposed. For example, Mosteller and Tukey (1977) [ 22 ] distinguished grades, ranks, counted fractions, counts, amounts, and balances. Nelder (1990) [ 23 ] described continuous counts, continuous ratios, count ratios, and categorical modes of data. (See also: Chrisman (1998), [ 24 ] van den Berg (1991).

[ 30 ] Consider independent identically distributed (IID) random variables with a given probability distribution : standard statistical inference and estimation theory defines a random sample as the random vector given by the column vector of these IID variables. [ 31 ] The population being examined is described by a probability distribution that may have unknown parameters. A statistic is a random variable that is a function of the random sample, but not a function of unknown parameters . The probability distribution of the statistic, though, may have unknown parameters. Consider now a function of the unknown parameter: an estimator is a statistic used to estimate such function. Commonly used estimators include sample mean , unbiased sample variance and sample covariance . A random variable that is a function of the random sample and of the unknown parameter, but whose probability distribution does not depend on the unknown parameter is called a pivotal quantity or pivot. Widely used pivots include the z-score , the chi square statistic and Student's t-value . Between two estimators of a given parameter, the one with lower mean squared error is said to be more efficient . Furthermore, an estimator is said to be unbiased if its expected value is equal to the true value of the unknown parameter being estimated, and asymptotically unbiased if its expected value converges at the limit to the true value of such parameter. Other desirable properties for estimators include: UMVUE estimators that have the lowest variance for all possible values of the parameter"

Other desirable properties for estimators include: UMVUE estimators that have the lowest variance for all possible values of the parameter to be estimated (this is usually an easier property to verify than efficiency) and consistent estimators which converges in probability to the true value of such parameter. This still leaves the question of how to obtain estimators in a given situation and carry the computation, several methods have been proposed: the method of moments , the maximum likelihood method, the least squares method and the more recent method of estimating equations . Interpretation of statistical information can often involve the development of a null hypothesis which is usually (but not necessarily) that no relationship exists among variables or that no change occurred over time. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] The alternative hypothesis is the name of the hypothesis that contradicts the null hypothesis. The best illustration for a novice is the predicament encountered by a criminal trial . The null hypothesis, H 0 , asserts that the defendant is innocent, whereas the alternative hypothesis, H 1 , asserts that the defendant is guilty . The indictment comes because of suspicion of the guilt. The H 0 (the status quo ) stands in opposition to H 1 and is maintained unless H 1 is supported by evidence \"beyond a reasonable doubt\". However, \"failure to reject H 0 \" in this case does not imply innocence, but merely that the evidence was insufficient to convict.

So the jury does not necessarily accept H 0 but fails to reject H 0 . While one can not \"prove\" a null hypothesis, one can test how close it is to being true with a power test , which tests for type II errors . Working from a null hypothesis , two broad categories of error are recognized: Standard deviation refers to the extent to which individual observations in a sample differ from a central value, such as the sample or population mean, while Standard error refers to an estimate of difference between sample mean and population mean. A statistical error is the amount by which an observation differs from its expected value . A residual is the amount an observation differs from the value the estimator of the expected value assumes on a given sample (also called prediction). Mean squared error is used for obtaining efficient estimators , a widely used class of estimators. Root mean square error is simply the square root of mean squared error. Many statistical methods seek to minimize the residual sum of squares , and these are called \" methods of least squares \" in contrast to Least absolute deviations . The latter gives equal weight to small and big errors, while the former gives more weight to large errors. Residual sum of squares is also differentiable , which provides a handy property for doing regression . Least squares applied to linear regression is called ordinary least squares method and least squares applied to nonlinear regression is called non-linear least squares .

    "text": "Probability is a branch of mathematics and statistics concerning events and numerical descriptions of how likely they are to occur. The probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1; the larger the probability, the more likely an event is to occur. [ note 1 ] [ 1 ] [ 2 ] This number is often expressed as a percentage (%), ranging from 0% to 100%. A simple example is the tossing of a fair (unbiased) coin. Since the coin is fair, the two outcomes (\"heads\" and \"tails\") are both equally probable; the probability of \"heads\" equals the probability of \"tails\"; and since no other outcomes are possible, the probability of either \"heads\" or \"tails\" is 1/2 (which could also be written as 0.5 or 50%). These concepts have been given an axiomatic mathematical formalization in probability theory , which is used widely in areas of study such as statistics , mathematics , science , finance , gambling , artificial intelligence , machine learning , computer science , game theory , and philosophy to, for example, draw inferences about the expected frequency of events. Probability theory is also used to describe the underlying mechanics and regularities of complex systems . [ 3 ] The word probability derives from the Latin probabilitas , which can also mean \" probity \", a measure of the authority of a witness in a legal case in Europe, and often correlated with the witness's nobility . In a sense, this differs much from the modern meaning of probability , which in contrast is a measure of the weight of empirical evidence , and is arrived at from inductive reasoning and statistical inference .

[ 4 ] When dealing with random experiments – i.e., experiments that are random and well-defined – in a purely theoretical setting (like tossing a coin), probabilities can be numerically described by the number of desired outcomes, divided by the total number of all outcomes. This is referred to as theoretical probability (in contrast to empirical probability , dealing with probabilities in the context of real experiments). The probability is a number between 0 and 1; the larger the probability, the more likely the desired outcome is to occur. For example, tossing a coin twice will yield \"head-head\", \"head-tail\", \"tail-head\", and \"tail-tail\" outcomes. The probability of getting an outcome of \"head-head\" is 1 out of 4 outcomes, or, in numerical terms, 1/4, 0.25 or 25%. The probability of getting an outcome of at least one head is 3 out of 4, or 0.75, and this event is more likely to occur. However, when it comes to practical application, there are two major competing categories of probability interpretations, whose adherents hold different views about the fundamental nature of probability: The scientific study of probability is a modern development of mathematics. Gambling shows that there has been an interest in quantifying the ideas of probability throughout history, but exact mathematical descriptions arose much later. There are reasons for the slow development of the mathematics of probability. Whereas games of chance provided the impetus for the mathematical study of probability, fundamental issues [ note 2 ] are still obscured by superstitions.

[ 11 ] According to Richard Jeffrey , \"Before the middle of the seventeenth century, the term 'probable' (Latin probabilis ) meant approvable , and was applied in that sense, univocally, to opinion and to action. A probable action or opinion was one such as sensible people would undertake or hold, in the circumstances.\" [ 12 ] However, in legal contexts especially, 'probable' could also apply to propositions for which there was good evidence. [ 13 ] The sixteenth-century Italian polymath Gerolamo Cardano demonstrated the efficacy of defining odds as the ratio of favourable to unfavourable outcomes (which implies that the probability of an event is given by the ratio of favourable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes [ 14 ] ). Aside from the elementary work by Cardano, the doctrine of probabilities dates to the correspondence of Pierre de Fermat and Blaise Pascal (1654). Christiaan Huygens (1657) gave the earliest known scientific treatment of the subject. [ 15 ] Jakob Bernoulli 's Ars Conjectandi (posthumous, 1713) and Abraham de Moivre 's Doctrine of Chances (1718) treated the subject as a branch of mathematics. [ 16 ] See Ian Hacking 's The Emergence of Probability [ 4 ] and James Franklin's The Science of Conjecture [ 17 ] for histories of the early development of the very concept of mathematical probability.

[ 18 ] The reprint (1757) of this memoir lays down the axioms that positive and negative errors are equally probable, and that certain assignable limits define the range of all errors. Simpson also discusses continuous errors and describes a probability curve. The first two laws of error that were proposed both originated with Pierre-Simon Laplace . The first law was published in 1774, and stated that the frequency of an error could be expressed as an exponential function of the numerical magnitude of the error – disregarding sign. The second law of error was proposed in 1778 by Laplace, and stated that the frequency of the error is an exponential function of the square of the error. [ 19 ] The second law of error is called the normal distribution or the Gauss law. \"It is difficult historically to attribute that law to Gauss, who in spite of his well-known precocity had probably not made this discovery before he was two years old.\" [ 19 ] Daniel Bernoulli (1778) introduced the principle of the maximum product of the probabilities of a system of concurrent errors. Adrien-Marie Legendre (1805) developed the method of least squares , and introduced it in his Nouvelles méthodes pour la détermination des orbites des comètes ( New Methods for Determining the Orbits of Comets ).

He gave two proofs, the second being essentially the same as John Herschel 's (1850). [ citation needed ] Gauss gave the first proof that seems to have been known in Europe (the third after Adrain's) in 1809. Further proofs were given by Laplace (1810, 1812), Gauss (1823), James Ivory (1825, 1826), Hagen (1837), Friedrich Bessel (1838), W.F. Donkin (1844, 1856), and Morgan Crofton (1870). Other contributors were Ellis (1844), De Morgan (1864), Glaisher (1872), and Giovanni Schiaparelli (1875). Peters 's (1856) formula [ clarification needed ] for r , the probable error of a single observation, is well known.

Like other theories , the theory of probability is a representation of its concepts in formal terms – that is, in terms that can be considered separately from their meaning. These formal terms are manipulated by the rules of mathematics and logic, and any results are interpreted or translated back into the problem domain. There have been at least two successful attempts to formalize probability, namely the Kolmogorov formulation and the Cox formulation. In Kolmogorov's formulation (see also probability space ), sets are interpreted as events and probability as a measure on a class of sets. In Cox's theorem , probability is taken as a primitive (i.e., not further analyzed), and the emphasis is on constructing a consistent assignment of probability values to propositions. In both cases, the laws of probability are the same, except for technical details. There are other methods for quantifying uncertainty, such as the Dempster–Shafer theory or possibility theory , but those are essentially different and not compatible with the usually-understood laws of probability. Probability theory is applied in everyday life in risk assessment and modeling . The insurance industry and markets use actuarial science to determine pricing and make trading decisions.

An example of the use of probability theory in equity trading is the effect of the perceived probability of any widespread Middle East conflict on oil prices, which have ripple effects in the economy as a whole. An assessment by a commodity trader that a war is more likely can send that commodity's prices up or down, and signals other traders of that opinion. Accordingly, the probabilities are neither assessed independently nor necessarily rationally. The theory of behavioral finance emerged to describe the effect of such groupthink on pricing, on policy, and on peace and conflict. [ 24 ] In addition to financial assessment, probability can be used to analyze trends in biology (e.g., disease spread) as well as ecology (e.g., biological Punnett squares ). [ 25 ] As with finance, risk assessment can be used as a statistical tool to calculate the likelihood of undesirable events occurring, and can assist with implementing protocols to avoid encountering such circumstances. Probability is used to design games of chance so that casinos can make a guaranteed profit, yet provide payouts to players that are frequent enough to encourage continued play. [ 26 ] Another significant application of probability theory in everyday life is reliability . Many consumer products, such as automobiles and consumer electronics, use reliability theory in product design to reduce the probability of failure. Failure probability may influence a manufacturer's decisions on a product's warranty .

The power set of the sample space is formed by considering all different collections of possible results. For example, rolling a die can produce six possible results. One collection of possible results gives an odd number on the die. Thus, the subset {1,3,5} is an element of the power set of the sample space of dice rolls. These collections are called \"events\". In this case, {1,3,5} is the event that the die falls on some odd number. If the results that actually occur fall in a given event, the event is said to have occurred. A probability is a way of assigning every event a value between zero and one, with the requirement that the event made up of all possible results (in our example, the event {1,2,3,4,5,6}) is assigned a value of one. To qualify as a probability, the assignment of values must satisfy the requirement that for any collection of mutually exclusive events (events with no common results, such as the events {1,6}, {3}, and {2,4}), the probability that at least one of the events will occur is given by the sum of the probabilities of all the individual events.

In a deterministic universe, based on Newtonian concepts, there would be no probability if all conditions were known ( Laplace's demon ) (but there are situations in which sensitivity to initial conditions exceeds our ability to measure them, i.e. know them). In the case of a roulette wheel, if the force of the hand and the period of that force are known, the number on which the ball will stop would be a certainty (though as a practical matter, this would likely be true only of a roulette wheel that had not been exactly levelled – as Thomas A. Bass' Newtonian Casino revealed). This also assumes knowledge of inertia and friction of the wheel, weight, smoothness, and roundness of the ball, variations in hand speed during the turning, and so forth. A probabilistic description can thus be more useful than Newtonian mechanics for analyzing the pattern of outcomes of repeated rolls of a roulette wheel.

Number theorists study prime numbers as well as the properties of mathematical objects constructed from integers (for example, rational numbers ), or defined as generalizations of the integers (for example, algebraic integers ). Integers can be considered either in themselves or as solutions to equations ( Diophantine geometry ). Questions in number theory can often be understood through the study of analytical objects, such as the Riemann zeta function , that encode properties of the integers, primes or other number-theoretic objects in some fashion ( analytic number theory ). One may also study real numbers in relation to rational numbers, as for instance how irrational numbers can be approximated by fractions ( Diophantine approximation ). Number theory is one of the oldest branches of mathematics alongside geometry. One quirk of number theory is that it deals with statements that are simple to understand but are very difficult to solve. Examples of this are Fermat's Last Theorem , which was proved 358 years after the original formulation, and Goldbach's conjecture , which remains unsolved since the 18th century. German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) once remarked, \"Mathematics is the queen of the sciences—and number theory is the queen of mathematics.\" [ 1 ] It was regarded as the epitome of pure mathematics, with no applications outside mathematics, until the 1970s, when prime numbers became the basis for the creation of public-key cryptography algorithms, such as the RSA cryptosystem .

[ 18 ] In recorded history, knowledge of numbers existed in the ancient civilisations of Mesopotamia, Egypt, China, and India.

[ 24 ] Although other civilizations probably influenced Greek mathematics at the beginning, [ 25 ] all evidence of such borrowings appear relatively late, [ 26 ] [ 27 ] and it is likely that Greek arithmētikḗ (the theoretical or philosophical study of numbers) is an indigenous tradition. [ 28 ] The ancient Greeks developed a keen interest in divisibility . The Pythagoreans attributed mystical quality to perfect and amicable numbers . The Pythagorean tradition also spoke of so-called polygonal or figurate numbers . [ 29 ] Euclid devoted part of his Elements to topics that belong to elementary number theory, including prime numbers and divisibility . [ 30 ] He gave the Euclidean algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor of two numbers and a proof implying the infinitude of primes . The foremost authority in arithmētikḗ in Late Antiquity was Diophantus of Alexandria , who probably lived in the 3rd century AD. He wrote Arithmetica , a collection of worked-out problems where the task is invariably to find rational solutions to a system of polynomial equations, usually of the form f ( x , y ) = z 2 {\\displaystyle f(x,y)=z^{2}} or f ( x , y , z ) = w 2 {\\displaystyle f(x,y,z)=w^{2}} .

The Chinese remainder theorem appears as an exercise [ 31 ] in Sunzi Suanjing (between the third and fifth centuries). [ 32 ] The result was later generalized with a complete solution called Da-yan-shu ( 大衍術 ) in Qin Jiushao 's 1247 Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections . [ 33 ] [ 34 ] There is also some numerical mysticism in Chinese mathematics, [ note 3 ] but, unlike that of the Pythagoreans, it seems to have led nowhere. While Greek astronomy probably influenced Indian learning [ 35 ] it seems to be the case that Indian mathematics is otherwise an autochthonous tradition. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] Āryabhaṭa (476–550 AD) showed that pairs of simultaneous congruences n ≡ a 1 mod m 1 {\\displaystyle n\\equiv a_{1}{\\bmod {m}}_{1}} , n ≡ a 2 mod m 2 {\\displaystyle n\\equiv a_{2}{\\bmod {m}}_{2}} could be solved by a method he called kuṭṭaka , or pulveriser ; [ 38 ] this is a procedure close to the Euclidean algorithm. [ 39 ] Āryabhaṭa seems to have had in mind applications to astronomical calculations. [ 35 ] Brahmagupta (628 AD) started the systematic study of indefinite quadratic equations—in particular, the Pell equation . A general procedure for solving Pell's equation was probably found by Jayadeva ; the earliest surviving exposition appears in Bhāskara II 's Bīja-gaṇita (twelfth century).

[ 41 ] [ 42 ] Diophantus's main work, the Arithmetica , was translated into Arabic by Qusta ibn Luqa (820–912). Part of the treatise al-Fakhri (by al-Karajī , 953 – c. 1029) builds on it to some extent. According to Rashed Roshdi, Al-Karajī's contemporary Ibn al-Haytham knew [ 43 ] what would later be called Wilson's theorem . Other than a treatise on squares in arithmetic progression by Fibonacci no number theory to speak of was done in western Europe during the Middle Ages. Matters started to change in Europe in the late Renaissance , thanks to a renewed study of the works of Greek antiquity. A catalyst was the textual emendation and translation into Latin of Diophantus' Arithmetica . [ 44 ] French mathematician Pierre de Fermat (1607–1665) never published his writings but communicated through correspondence and wrote in marginal notes instead. [ 45 ] His contributions to number theory brought renewed interest in the field in Europe. He conjectured Fermat's little theorem , a basic result in modular arithmetic, and Fermat's Last Theorem , as well as proved Fermat's right triangle theorem . [ 2 ] [ 46 ] He also studied prime numbers, the four-square theorem , and Pell's equations . [ 47 ] [ 48 ] The interest of Leonhard Euler (1707–1783) in number theory was first spurred in 1729, when a friend of his, the amateur [ note 4 ] Christian Goldbach , pointed him towards some of Fermat's work on the subject.

[ 49 ] [ 50 ] This has been called the \"rebirth\" of modern number theory, [ 51 ] after Fermat's relative lack of success in getting his contemporaries' attention for the subject. [ 52 ] He proved Fermat's assertions, including Fermat's little theorem ; made initial work towards a proof that every integer is the sum of four squares; [ 53 ] and specific cases of Fermat's Last Theorem. [ 54 ] He wrote on the link between continued fractions and Pell's equation. [ 55 ] [ 56 ] He made the first steps towards analytic number theory. [ 57 ] Three European contemporaries continued the work in elementary number theory. Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736–1813) gave full proofs of the four-square theorem , Wilson's theorem , and developed the basic theory of Pell's equations. Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752–1833) stated the law of quadratic reciprocity. He also conjectured what amounts to the prime number theorem and Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions . He gave a full treatment of the equation a x 2 + b y 2 + c z 2 = 0 {\\displaystyle ax^{2}+by^{2}+cz^{2}=0} .

He also introduced some basic notation to congruences and devoted a section to computational matters, including primality tests. [ 61 ] He established a link between roots of unity and number theory. [ 62 ] In this way, Gauss arguably made forays towards Évariste Galois 's work and the area algebraic number theory . Starting early in the nineteenth century, the following developments gradually took place: Algebraic number theory may be said to start with the study of reciprocity and cyclotomy , but truly came into its own with the development of abstract algebra and early ideal theory and valuation theory; see below. A conventional starting point for analytic number theory is Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions (1837), [ 64 ] [ 65 ] whose proof introduced L-functions and involved some asymptotic analysis and a limiting process on a real variable. [ 66 ] The first use of analytic ideas in number theory actually goes back to Euler (1730s), [ 67 ] [ 68 ] who used formal power series and non-rigorous (or implicit) limiting arguments. The use of complex analysis in number theory comes later: the work of Bernhard Riemann (1859) on the zeta function is the canonical starting point; [ 69 ] Jacobi's four-square theorem (1839), which predates it, belongs to an initially different strand that has by now taken a leading role in analytic number theory ( modular forms ).

Elementary number theory deals with the topics in number theory by means of basic methods in arithmetic.

Euclid's division lemma asserts that a {\\displaystyle a} and b {\\displaystyle b} can generally be written as a = b q + r {\\displaystyle a=bq+r} , where the remainder r {\\displaystyle r} accounts for the smallest positive leftover quantity. Elementary number theory studies divisibility rules in order to quickly identify if a given integer is divisible by a fixed divisor. For instance, it is known that any integer is divisible by 3 if its decimal digit sum is divisible by 3. [ 74 ] [ 9 ] [ 75 ] A common divisor of several nonzero integers is an integer that divides all of them. The greatest common divisor (gcd) is the largest of such divisors. Two integers are said to be coprime or relatively prime to one another if their greatest common divisor, and simultaneously their only divisor, is 1.

[ 76 ] Elementary number theory studies the divisibility properties of integers such as parity (even and odd numbers), prime numbers , and perfect numbers . Important number-theoretic functions include the divisor-counting function , the divisor summatory function and its modifications, and Euler's totient function . A prime number is an integer greater than 1 whose only positive divisors are 1 and the prime itself. A positive integer greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number.

The unique factorization theorem is the fundamental theorem of arithmetic that relates to prime factorization. The theorem states that every integer greater than 1 can be factorised into a product of prime numbers and that this factorisation is unique up to the order of the factors.

Euler's theorem extends this to assert that every integer n {\\displaystyle n} satisfies the congruence a φ ( n ) ≡ 1 ( mod n ) , {\\displaystyle a^{\\varphi (n)}\\equiv 1{\\pmod {n}},} where Euler's totient function φ {\\displaystyle \\varphi } counts all positive integers up to n {\\displaystyle n} that are coprime to n {\\displaystyle n} . Modular arithmetic also provides formulas that are used to solve congruences with unknowns in a similar vein to equation solving in algebra, such as the Chinese remainder theorem . [ 79 ] Analytic number theory, in contrast to elementary number theory, relies on complex numbers and techniques from analysis and calculus. Analytic number theory may be defined It studies the distribution of primes, behavior of number-theoretic functions, and irrational numbers.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Linear algebra is central to almost all areas of mathematics. For instance, linear algebra is fundamental in modern presentations of geometry , including for defining basic objects such as lines , planes and rotations . Also, functional analysis , a branch of mathematical analysis , may be viewed as the application of linear algebra to function spaces . Linear algebra is also used in most sciences and fields of engineering because it allows modeling many natural phenomena, and computing efficiently with such models. For nonlinear systems , which cannot be modeled with linear algebra, it is often used for dealing with first-order approximations , using the fact that the differential of a multivariate function at a point is the linear map that best approximates the function near that point. The procedure (using counting rods) for solving simultaneous linear equations now called Gaussian elimination appears in the ancient Chinese mathematical text Chapter Eight: Rectangular Arrays of The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art . Its use is illustrated in eighteen problems, with two to five equations. [ 4 ] Systems of linear equations arose in Europe with the introduction in 1637 by René Descartes of coordinates in geometry . In fact, in this new geometry, now called Cartesian geometry , lines and planes are represented by linear equations, and computing their intersections amounts to solving systems of linear equations. The first systematic methods for solving linear systems used determinants and were first considered by Leibniz in 1693. In 1750, Gabriel Cramer used them for giving explicit solutions of linear systems, now called Cramer's rule . Later,"

Later, Gauss further described the method of elimination, which was initially listed as an advancement in geodesy . [ 5 ] In 1844 Hermann Grassmann published his \"Theory of Extension\" which included foundational new topics of what is today called linear algebra. In 1848, James Joseph Sylvester introduced the term matrix , which is Latin for womb . Linear algebra grew with ideas noted in the complex plane . For instance, two numbers w and z in C {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} } have a difference w – z , and the line segments wz and 0( w − z ) are of the same length and direction. The segments are equipollent . The four-dimensional system H {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {H} } of quaternions was discovered by W.R. Hamilton in 1843. [ 6 ] The term vector was introduced as v = x i + y j + z k representing a point in space. The quaternion difference p – q also produces a segment equipollent to pq . Other hypercomplex number systems also used the idea of a linear space with a basis . Arthur Cayley introduced matrix multiplication and the inverse matrix in 1856, making possible the general linear group . The mechanism of group representation became available for describing complex and hypercomplex numbers. Crucially, Cayley used a single letter to denote a matrix, thus treating a matrix as an aggregate object.

[ 5 ] Benjamin Peirce published his Linear Associative Algebra (1872), and his son Charles Sanders Peirce extended the work later. [ 7 ] The telegraph required an explanatory system, and the 1873 publication by James Clerk Maxwell of A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism instituted a field theory of forces and required differential geometry for expression. Linear algebra is flat differential geometry and serves in tangent spaces to manifolds . Electromagnetic symmetries of spacetime are expressed by the Lorentz transformations , and much of the history of linear algebra is the history of Lorentz transformations . The first modern and more precise definition of a vector space was introduced by Peano in 1888; [ 5 ] by 1900, a theory of linear transformations of finite-dimensional vector spaces had emerged. Linear algebra took its modern form in the first half of the twentieth century when many ideas and methods of previous centuries were generalized as abstract algebra . The development of computers led to increased research in efficient algorithms for Gaussian elimination and matrix decompositions, and linear algebra became an essential tool for modeling and simulations.

A vector space over a field F (often the field of the real numbers or of the complex numbers ) is a set V equipped with two binary operations . Elements of V are called vectors , and elements of F are called scalars . The first operation, vector addition , takes any two vectors v and w and outputs a third vector v + w . The second operation, scalar multiplication , takes any scalar a and any vector v and outputs a new vector a v . The axioms that addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy are the following. (In the list below, u , v and w are arbitrary elements of V , and a and b are arbitrary scalars in the field F .) [ 8 ] The first four axioms mean that V is an abelian group under addition. The elements of a specific vector space may have various natures; for example, they could be tuples , sequences , functions , polynomials , or matrices . Linear algebra is concerned with the properties of such objects that are common to all vector spaces. Linear maps are mappings between vector spaces that preserve the vector-space structure.

An equivalent condition is that for any vectors u , v in V and scalars a , b in F . When V = W are the same vector space, a linear map T : V → V is also known as a linear operator on V . A bijective linear map between two vector spaces (that is, every vector from the second space is associated with exactly one in the first) is an isomorphism . Because an isomorphism preserves linear structure, two isomorphic vector spaces are \"essentially the same\" from the linear algebra point of view, in the sense that they cannot be distinguished by using vector space properties. An essential question in linear algebra is testing whether a linear map is an isomorphism or not, and, if it is not an isomorphism, finding its range (or image) and the set of elements that are mapped to the zero vector, called the kernel of the map. All these questions can be solved by using Gaussian elimination or some variant of this algorithm . The study of those subsets of vector spaces that are in themselves vector spaces under the induced operations is fundamental, similarly as for many mathematical structures. These subsets are called linear subspaces . More precisely, a linear subspace of a vector space V over a field F is a subset W of V such that u + v and a u are in W , for every u , v in W ,"

For example, given a linear map T : V → W , the image T ( V ) of V , and the inverse image T −1 ( 0 ) of 0 (called kernel or null space), are linear subspaces of W and V , respectively. Another important way of forming a subspace is to consider linear combinations of a set S of vectors: the set of all sums where v 1 , v 2 , ..., v k are in S , and a 1 , a 2 , ..., a k are in F form a linear subspace called the span of S . The span of S is also the intersection of all linear subspaces containing S . In other words, it is the smallest (for the inclusion relation) linear subspace containing S . A set of vectors is linearly independent if none is in the span of the others. Equivalently, a set S of vectors is linearly independent if the only way to express the zero vector as a linear combination of elements of S is to take zero for every coefficient a i .

One may continue to remove elements of S until getting a linearly independent spanning set . Such a linearly independent set that spans a vector space V is called a basis of V . The importance of bases lies in the fact that they are simultaneously minimal-generating sets and maximal independent sets. More precisely, if S is a linearly independent set, and T is a spanning set such that S ⊆ T , then there is a basis B such that S ⊆ B ⊆ T . Any two bases of a vector space V have the same cardinality , which is called the dimension of V ; this is the dimension theorem for vector spaces . Moreover, two vector spaces over the same field F are isomorphic if and only if they have the same dimension.

By definition of a basis, the map is a bijection from F m , the set of the sequences of m elements of F , onto V . This is an isomorphism of vector spaces, if F m is equipped with its standard structure of vector space, where vector addition and scalar multiplication are done component by component.

It follows that the theory of finite-dimensional vector spaces and the theory of matrices are two different languages for expressing the same concepts. Two matrices that encode the same linear transformation in different bases are called similar . It can be proved that two matrices are similar if and only if one can transform one into the other by elementary row and column operations . For a matrix representing a linear map from W to V , the row operations correspond to change of bases in V and the column operations correspond to change of bases in W . Every matrix is similar to an identity matrix possibly bordered by zero rows and zero columns. In terms of vector spaces, this means that, for any linear map from W to V , there are bases such that a part of the basis of W is mapped bijectively on a part of the basis of V , and that the remaining basis elements of W , if any, are mapped to zero.

To such a system, one may associate its matrix and its right member vector Let T be the linear transformation associated with the matrix M . A solution of the system ( S ) is a vector such that that is an element of the preimage of v by T . Let ( S′ ) be the associated homogeneous system , where the right-hand sides of the equations are put to zero: The solutions of ( S′ ) are exactly the elements of the kernel of T or, equivalently, M .

[ 1 ] This result did not depend on the lengths of the bridges or on their distance from one another, but only on connectivity properties: which bridges connect to which islands or riverbanks. This Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem led to the branch of mathematics known as graph theory . [ 2 ] Similarly, the hairy ball theorem of algebraic topology says that \"one cannot comb the hair flat on a hairy ball without creating a cowlick .\" [ 3 ] This fact is immediately convincing to most people, even though they might not recognize the more formal statement of the theorem, that there is no nonvanishing continuous tangent vector field on the sphere. As with the Bridges of Königsberg , the result does not depend on the shape of the sphere; it applies to any kind of smooth blob, as long as it has no holes. To deal with these problems that do not rely on the exact shape of the objects, one must be clear about just what properties these problems do rely on. From this need arises the notion of homeomorphism . The impossibility of crossing each bridge"

From this need arises the notion of homeomorphism . The impossibility of crossing each bridge just once applies to any arrangement of bridges homeomorphic to those in Königsberg, and the hairy ball theorem applies to any space homeomorphic to a sphere. Intuitively, two spaces are homeomorphic if one can be deformed into the other without cutting or gluing. A famous example, known as the \"Topologist's Breakfast\", is that a topologist cannot distinguish a coffee mug from a doughnut. [ 4 ] A pliable torus (shaped like a doughnut) can be reshaped to a coffee mug by creating a dimple and progressively enlarging it while shrinking the central hole into the mug's handle. [ 5 ] Homeomorphism can be considered the most basic topological equivalence . Another is homotopy equivalence . This is harder to describe without getting technical, but the essential notion is that two objects are homotopy equivalent if they both result from \"squishing\" some larger object. Topology, as a well-defined mathematical discipline, originates in the early part of the twentieth century, but some isolated results can be traced back several centuries. [ 6 ] Among these are certain questions in geometry investigated by Leonhard Euler . His 1736 paper on the Seven Bridges of Königsberg is regarded as one of the first practical applications of topology. [ 6 ] On 14 November 1750, Euler wrote to a friend that he had realized the importance of the edges of a polyhedron .

Some authorities regard this analysis as the first theorem, signaling the birth of topology. [ 7 ] Further contributions were made by Augustin-Louis Cauchy , Ludwig Schläfli , Johann Benedict Listing , Bernhard Riemann and Enrico Betti . [ 8 ] Listing introduced the term \"Topologie\" in Vorstudien zur Topologie , written in his native German, in 1847, having used the word for ten years in correspondence before its first appearance in print. [ 9 ] The English form \"topology\" was used in 1883 in Listing's obituary in the journal Nature to distinguish \"qualitative geometry from the ordinary geometry in which quantitative relations chiefly are treated\". [ 10 ] Their work was corrected, consolidated and greatly extended by Henri Poincaré . In 1895, he published his ground-breaking paper on Analysis Situs , which introduced the concepts now known as homotopy and homology , which are now considered part of algebraic topology . [ 8 ] The development of topology in the 20th century was marked by significant advances in both foundational theory and its application to other fields of mathematics. Unifying the work on function spaces of Georg Cantor , Vito Volterra , Cesare Arzelà , Jacques Hadamard , Giulio Ascoli and others, Maurice Fréchet introduced the metric space in 1906.

[ 11 ] A metric space is now considered a special case of a general topological space, with any given topological space potentially giving rise to many distinct metric spaces. In 1914, Felix Hausdorff coined the term \"topological space\" and defined what is now called a Hausdorff space . [ 12 ] Currently, a topological space is a slight generalization of Hausdorff spaces, given in 1922 by Kazimierz Kuratowski . [ 13 ] Modern topology depends strongly on the ideas of set theory, developed by Georg Cantor in the later part of the 19th century. In addition to establishing the basic ideas of set theory, Cantor considered point sets in Euclidean space as part of his study of Fourier series . For further developments, see point-set topology and algebraic topology. The 2022 Abel Prize was awarded to Dennis Sullivan \"for his groundbreaking contributions to topology in its broadest sense, and in particular its algebraic, geometric and dynamical aspects\". [ 14 ] The term \"topology\" also refers to a specific mathematical idea central to the area of mathematics called topology. Informally, a topology describes how elements of a set relate spatially to each other. The same set can have different topologies. For instance, the real line , the complex plane , and the Cantor set can be thought of as the same set with different topologies. Formally, let X be a set and let τ be a family of subsets of X . Then τ is called a topology on X if: [ 15 ] If τ is a topology on X , then the pair ( X , τ ) is called a topological space. The notation X"

A subset of X is said to be closed if its complement is in τ (that is, its complement is open). A subset of X may be open, closed, both (a clopen set ), or neither. The empty set and X itself are always both closed and open. An open subset of X which contains a point x is called an open neighborhood of x . A function or map from one topological space to another is called continuous if the inverse image of any open set is open. If the function maps the real numbers to the real numbers (both spaces with the standard topology), then this definition of continuous is equivalent to the definition of continuous in calculus . If a continuous function is one-to-one and onto , and if the inverse of the function is also continuous, then the function is called a homeomorphism and the domain of the function is said to be homeomorphic to the range. Another way of saying this is that the function has a natural extension to the topology. If two spaces are homeomorphic, they have identical topological properties and are considered topologically the same. The cube and the sphere are homeomorphic, as are the coffee cup and the doughnut.

However, the sphere is not homeomorphic to the doughnut. While topological spaces can be extremely varied and exotic, many areas of topology focus on the more familiar class of spaces known as manifolds. A manifold is a topological space that resembles Euclidean space near each point. More precisely, each point of an n -dimensional manifold has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to the Euclidean space of dimension n . Lines and circles , but not figure eights , are one-dimensional manifolds. Two-dimensional manifolds are also called surfaces . Examples include the plane , the sphere , and the torus , which can all be realized in three dimensions without self-intersection, and the Klein bottle and real projective plane , which cannot. General topology is the branch of topology dealing with the basic set-theoretic definitions and constructions used in topology. [ 16 ] [ 17 ] It is the foundation of most other branches of topology, including differential topology, geometric topology, and algebraic topology. Another name for general topology is point-set topology.

Connected sets are sets that cannot be divided into two pieces that are far apart. The words nearby , arbitrarily small , and far apart can all be made precise by using open sets. Several topologies can be defined on a given set. Changing a topology consists of changing the collection of open sets. This changes which functions are continuous and which subsets are compact or connected. Metric spaces are an important class of topological spaces where the distance between any two points is defined by a function called a metric . In a metric space, an open set is a union of open disks, where an open disk of radius r centered at x is the set of all points whose distance to x is less than r . Many common spaces are topological spaces whose topology can be defined by a metric. This is the case of the real line , the complex plane , real and complex normed vector spaces and Euclidean spaces . Having a metric simplifies many proofs. Algebraic topology is a branch of mathematics that uses tools from algebra to study topological spaces. [ 18 ] The basic goal is to find algebraic invariants that classify topological spaces up to homeomorphism, or more commonly up to homotopy equivalence.

Algebraic topology, for example, allows for a convenient proof that any subgroup of a free group is again a free group. Differential topology is the field dealing with differentiable functions on differentiable manifolds . [ 19 ] It is closely related to differential geometry and together they make up the geometric theory of differentiable manifolds. More specifically, differential topology considers the properties and structures that require only a smooth structure on a manifold to be defined. Smooth manifolds are \"softer\" than manifolds with extra geometric structures, which can act as obstructions to certain types of equivalences and deformations that exist in differential topology. For instance, volume and Riemannian curvature are invariants that can distinguish different geometric structures on the same smooth manifold – that is, one can smoothly \"flatten out\" certain manifolds, but it might require distorting the space and affecting the curvature or volume. Geometric topology is a branch of topology that primarily focuses on low-dimensional manifolds (that is, spaces of dimensions 2, 3, and 4) and their interaction with geometry, but it also includes some higher-dimensional topology. [ 20 ] Some examples of topics in geometric topology are orientability , handle decompositions , local flatness , crumpling and the planar and higher-dimensional Schönflies theorem . In high-dimensional topology, characteristic classes are a basic invariant, and surgery theory is a key theory.

Occasionally, one needs to use the tools of topology but a \"set of points\" is not available. In pointless topology one considers instead the lattice of open sets as the basic notion of the theory, [ 21 ] while Grothendieck topologies are structures defined on arbitrary categories that allow the definition of sheaves on those categories and with that the definition of general cohomology theories. [ 22 ] Topology has been used to study various biological systems including molecules and nanostructure (e.g., membraneous objects). In particular, circuit topology and knot theory have been extensively applied to classify and compare the topology of folded proteins and nucleic acids. Circuit topology classifies folded molecular chains based on the pairwise arrangement of their intra-chain contacts and chain crossings.

[ 23 ] Topological data analysis uses techniques from algebraic topology to determine the large-scale structure of a set (for instance, determining if a cloud of points is spherical or toroidal ). The main method used by topological data analysis is to: Several branches of programming language semantics , such as domain theory , are formalized using topology. In this context, Steve Vickers , building on work by Samson Abramsky and Michael B. Smyth, characterizes topological spaces as Boolean or Heyting algebras over open sets, which are characterized as semidecidable (equivalently, finitely observable) properties.

[ 17 ] Marcel later came to reject the label himself in favour of Neo-Socratic , in honor of Kierkegaard's essay \" On the Concept of Irony \".

Sartre posits the idea that \"what all existentialists have in common is the fundamental doctrine that existence precedes essence \", as the philosopher Frederick Copleston explains. [ 19 ] According to philosopher Steven Crowell , defining existentialism has been relatively difficult, and he argues that it is better understood as a general approach used to reject certain systematic philosophies rather than as a systematic philosophy itself. [ 5 ] In a lecture delivered in 1945, Sartre described existentialism as \"the attempt to draw all the consequences from a position of consistent atheism \". [ 20 ] For others, existentialism need not involve the rejection of God, but rather \"examines mortal man's search for meaning in a meaningless universe\", considering less \"What is the good life?\" (to feel, be, or do, good), instead asking \"What is life good for?\". [ 21 ] Although many outside Scandinavia consider the term existentialism to have originated from Kierkegaard, it is more likely that Kierkegaard adopted this term (or at least the term \"existential\" as a description of his philosophy) from the Norwegian poet and literary critic Johan Sebastian Cammermeyer Welhaven . [ 22 ] This assertion comes from two sources: Sartre argued that a central proposition of existentialism is that existence precedes essence, which is to say that individuals shape themselves by existing and cannot be perceived through preconceived and a priori categories, an \"essence\".

[ 26 ] Although it was Sartre who explicitly coined the phrase, similar notions can be found in the thought of existentialist philosophers such as Heidegger, and Kierkegaard: The subjective thinker's form , the form of his communication, is his style . His form must be just as manifold as are the opposites that he holds together. The systematic eins, zwei, drei is an abstract form that also must inevitably run into trouble whenever it is to be applied to the concrete. To the same degree as the subjective thinker is concrete, to that same degree his form must also be concretely dialectical. But just as he himself is not a poet, not an ethicist, not a dialectician, so also his form is none of these directly. His form must first and last be related to existence, and in this regard he must have at his disposal the poetic, the ethical, the dialectical, the religious.

Historical accuracy and historical actuality are breadth. — Søren Kierkegaard ( Concluding Postscript , Hong pp. 357–358.) Some interpret the imperative to define oneself as meaning that anyone can wish to be anything. However, an existentialist philosopher would say such a wish constitutes an inauthentic existence – what Sartre would call \" bad faith \". Instead, the phrase should be taken to say that people are defined only insofar as they act and that they are responsible for their actions. Someone who acts cruelly towards other people is, by that act, defined as a cruel person. Such persons are themselves responsible for their new identity (cruel persons). This is opposed to their genes, or human nature , bearing the blame. As Sartre said in his lecture Existentialism is a Humanism : \"Man first of all exists, encounters himself, surges up in the world—and defines himself afterwards.\" The more positive, therapeutic aspect of this is also implied: a person can choose to act in a different way, and to be a good person instead of a cruel person.

Sedimentations are themselves products of past choices and can be changed by choosing differently in the present, but such changes happen slowly. They are a force of inertia that shapes the agent's evaluative outlook on the world until the transition is complete. [ 28 ] : 5, 9, 66 Sartre's definition of existentialism was based on Heidegger's magnum opus Being and Time (1927).

[ 31 ] Heidegger commented that \"the reversal of a metaphysical statement remains a metaphysical statement\", meaning that he thought Sartre had simply switched the roles traditionally attributed to essence and existence without interrogating these concepts and their history. [ 32 ] The notion of the absurd contains the idea that there is no meaning in the world beyond what meaning we give it. This meaninglessness also encompasses the amorality or \"unfairness\" of the world. This can be highlighted in the way it opposes the traditional Abrahamic religious perspective, which establishes that life's purpose is the fulfillment of God's commandments. [ 33 ] To live the life of the absurd means rejecting a life that finds or pursues specific meaning for man's existence since there is nothing to be discovered. According to Albert Camus, the world or the human being is not in itself absurd. The concept only emerges through the juxtaposition of the two; life becomes absurd due to the incompatibility between human beings and the world they inhabit. [ 33 ] This view constitutes one of the two interpretations of the absurd in existentialist literature. The second view, first elaborated by Søren Kierkegaard , holds that absurdity is limited to actions and choices of human beings. These are considered absurd since they issue from human freedom, undermining their foundation outside of themselves.

The possibility of having everything meaningful break down poses a threat of quietism , which is inherently against the existentialist philosophy.

It is the facts of one's personal life and as per Heidegger, it is \" the way in which we are thrown into the world .\" This can be more easily understood when considering facticity in relation to a person's past: one's past forms the person who exists in the present. However, to reduce a person to their past would ignore the change a person undergoes in the present and future, while saying that one's past is only what one was, would entirely detach it from the present self. A denial of one's concrete past constitutes an inauthentic lifestyle, and also applies to other kinds of facticity (having a human body with all its limitations, identity, values, etc.). [ 42 ] Facticity is a limitation and a condition of freedom. It is a limitation in that a large part of a person's facticity consists of things they did not choose (birthplace, etc.), but a condition of freedom in the sense that one's values most likely depend on these factors. However, even though one's facticity is fixed, it cannot determine a person: they may choose to assign as much value to their facticity as they choose.

There is nothing essential about his committing crimes, but he ascribes this meaning to his past. However, to disregard one's facticity during the evolution of one's sense of self would be a denial of the conditions shaping the present self and would be inauthentic. An example of the focus solely on possible projects without reflecting on one's current facticity would be continually thinking about future possibilities related to being rich (e.g. a better car, bigger house, better quality of life, etc.) without acknowledging the facticity of not currently having the financial means to do so . In this example, considering both facticity and transcendence, an authentic mode of being would be considering future projects that might improve one's current finances (e.g. putting in extra hours, or investing savings) in order to arrive at a real future, or future-facticity of a modest pay rise, further leading to purchase of an affordable car. Another aspect of facticity is that it entails angst . Freedom \"produces\" angst when limited by facticity and the lack of the possibility of having facticity to \"step in\" and take responsibility for something one has done also produces angst.

One is responsible for one's values, regardless of society's values. The focus on freedom in existentialism is related to the limits of responsibility one bears, as a result of one's freedom. The relationship between freedom and responsibility is one of interdependency and a clarification of freedom also clarifies that for which one is responsible. [ 43 ] [ 44 ] Many noted existentialists consider the theme of authentic existence important. Authenticity involves the idea that one has to \"create oneself\" and live in accordance with this self. For an authentic existence, one should act as oneself, not as \"one's acts\" or as \"one's genes\" or as any other essence requires. The authentic act is one in accordance with one's freedom. A component of freedom is facticity, but not to the degree that this facticity determines one's transcendent choices (one could then blame one's background for making the choice one made [chosen project, from one's transcendence]). Facticity, in relation to authenticity, involves acting on one's actual values when making a choice (instead of, like Kierkegaard's Aesthete, \"choosing\" randomly), so that one takes responsibility for the act instead of choosing either-or without allowing the options to have different values. [ 45 ] In contrast, the inauthentic is the denial to live [ clarification needed ] in accordance with one's freedom. This can take many forms, from pretending choices are meaningless or random, convincing oneself that some form of determinism is true, or \"mimicry\" where one acts as \"one should\".

In Being and Nothingness , Sartre uses the example of a waiter in \"bad faith\". He merely takes part in the \"act\" of being a typical waiter, albeit very convincingly. [ 46 ] This image usually corresponds to a social norm, but this does not mean that all acting in accordance with social norms is inauthentic. The main point is the attitude one takes to one's own freedom and responsibility and the extent to which one acts in accordance with this freedom. [ 47 ] The Other (written with a capital \"O\") is a concept more properly belonging to phenomenology and its account of intersubjectivity . However, it has seen widespread use in existentialist writings, and the conclusions drawn differ slightly from the phenomenological accounts. The Other is the experience of another free subject who inhabits the same world as a person does. In its most basic form, it is this experience of the Other that constitutes intersubjectivity and objectivity. To clarify, when one experiences someone else, and this Other person experiences the world (the same world that a person experiences)—only from \"over there\"—the world is constituted as objective in that it is something that is \"there\" as identical for both of the subjects; a person experiences the other person as experiencing the same things.

This is because the Look tends to objectify what it sees. When one experiences oneself in the Look, one does not experience oneself as nothing (no thing), but as something (some thing). In Sartre's example of a man peeping at someone through a keyhole, the man is entirely caught up in the situation he is in. He is in a pre-reflexive state where his entire consciousness is directed at what goes on in the room. Suddenly, he hears a creaking floorboard behind him and he becomes aware of himself as seen by the Other. He is then filled with shame for he perceives himself as he would perceive someone else doing what he was doing—as a Peeping Tom . For Sartre, this phenomenological experience of shame establishes proof for the existence of other minds and defeats the problem of solipsism . For the conscious state of shame to be experienced, one has to become aware of oneself as an object of another look, proving a priori, that other minds exist.

[ 1 ] It works to uncover the structural patterns that underlie all things that humans do , think , perceive , and feel . Alternatively, as summarized by philosopher Simon Blackburn , structuralism is: [ 2 ] \"The belief that phenomena of human life are not intelligible except through their interrelations. These relations constitute a structure, and behind local variations in the surface phenomena there are constant laws of abstract structure.\" The term structuralism is ambiguous, referring to different schools of thought in different contexts. As such, the movement in humanities and social sciences called structuralism relates to sociology . Emile Durkheim based his sociological concept on 'structure' and 'function', and from his work emerged the sociological approach of structural functionalism . Apart from Durkheim's use of the term structure , the semiological concept of Ferdinand de Saussure became fundamental for structuralism. Saussure conceived language and society as a system of relations. His linguistic approach was also a refutation of evolutionary linguistics . Structuralism in Europe developed in the early 20th century, mainly in France and the Russian Empire , in the structural linguistics of Ferdinand de Saussure and the subsequent Prague , Moscow , and Copenhagen schools of linguistics.

Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, existentialism , such as that propounded by Jean-Paul Sartre , was the dominant European intellectual movement . Structuralism rose to prominence in France in the wake of existentialism, particularly in the 1960s. The initial popularity of structuralism in France led to its spread across the globe. By the early 1960s, structuralism as a movement was coming into its own and some believed that it offered a single unified approach to human life that would embrace all disciplines. By the late 1960s, many of structuralism's basic tenets came under attack from a new wave of predominantly French intellectuals/philosophers such as historian Michel Foucault , Jacques Derrida , Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser , and literary critic Roland Barthes . Though elements of their work necessarily relate to structuralism and are informed by it, these theorists eventually came to be referred to as post-structuralists . Many proponents of structuralism, such as Lacan , continue to influence continental philosophy and many of the fundamental assumptions of some of structuralism's post-structuralist critics are a continuation of structuralist thinking. Russian functional linguist Roman Jakobson was a pivotal figure in the adaptation of structural analysis to disciplines beyond linguistics, including philosophy, anthropology, and literary theory.

This included such writers as Louis Althusser and psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan , as well as the structural Marxism of Nicos Poulantzas . Roland Barthes and Jacques Derrida focused on how structuralism could be applied to literature . The origins of structuralism are connected with the work of Ferdinand de Saussure on linguistics along with the linguistics of the Prague and Moscow schools. In brief, Saussure's structural linguistics propounded three related concepts. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Structuralism rejected the concept of human freedom and choice, focusing instead on the way that human experience and behaviour is determined by various structures. The most important initial work on this score was Lévi-Strauss's 1949 volume The Elementary Structures of Kinship . Lévi-Strauss had known Roman Jakobson during their time together at the New School in New York during WWII and was influenced by both Jakobson's structuralism, as well as the American anthropological tradition. In Elementary Structures , he examined kinship systems from a structural point of view and demonstrated how apparently different social organizations were different permutations of a few basic kinship structures. In the late 1958, he published Structural Anthropology , a collection of essays outlining his program for structuralism.

Similarly, Jean Piaget applied structuralism to the study of psychology , though in a different way. Piaget, who would better define himself as constructivist , considered structuralism as \"a method and not a doctrine,\" because, for him, \"there exists no structure without a construction, abstract or genetic.\" [ 5 ] Proponents of structuralism argue that a specific domain of culture may be understood by means of a structure that is modelled on language and is distinct both from the organizations of reality and those of ideas, or the imagination—the \"third order.\" [ 6 ] In Lacan's psychoanalytic theory, for example, the structural order of \" the Symbolic \" is distinguished both from \" the Real \" and \" the Imaginary ;\" similarly, in Althusser's Marxist theory, the structural order of the capitalist mode of production is distinct both from the actual, real agents involved in its relations and from the ideological forms in which those relations are understood. Although French theorist Louis Althusser is often associated with structural social analysis , which helped give rise to \" structural Marxism ,\" such association was contested by Althusser himself in the Italian foreword to the second edition of Reading Capital . In this foreword Althusser states the following: Despite the precautions we took to distinguish ourselves from the 'structuralist' ideology…, despite the decisive intervention of categories foreign to 'structuralism'…, the terminology we employed was too close in many respects to the 'structuralist' terminology not to give rise to an ambiguity.

[ 7 ] In a later development, feminist theorist Alison Assiter enumerated four ideas common to the various forms of structuralism: [ 8 ] In Ferdinand de Saussure 's Course in General Linguistics , the analysis focuses not on the use of language ( parole , 'speech'), but rather on the underlying system of language ( langue ). This approach examines how the elements of language relate to each other in the present, synchronically rather than diachronically . Saussure argued that linguistic signs were composed of two parts: This differed from previous approaches that focused on the relationship between words and the things in the world that they designate. [ 9 ] Although not fully developed by Saussure, other key notions in structural linguistics can be found in structural \"idealism.\" A structural idealism is a class of linguistic units ( lexemes , morphemes , or even constructions ) that are possible in a certain position in a given syntagm , or linguistic environment (such as a given sentence). The different functional role of each of these members of the paradigm is called 'value' ( French : valeur ).

The clearest and most important example of Prague school structuralism lies in phonemics . Rather than simply compiling a list of which sounds occur in a language, the Prague school examined how they were related. They determined that the inventory of sounds in a language could be analysed as a series of contrasts. Thus, in English, the sounds /p/ and /b/ represent distinct phonemes because there are cases ( minimal pairs ) where the contrast between the two is the only difference between two distinct words (e.g. 'pat' and 'bat'). Analyzing sounds in terms of contrastive features also opens up comparative scope—for instance, it makes clear the difficulty Japanese speakers have differentiating /r/ and /l/ in English and other languages is because these sounds are not contrastive in Japanese. Phonology would become the paradigmatic basis for structuralism in a number of different fields. Based on the Prague school concept, André Martinet in France, J. R. Firth in the UK and Louis Hjelmslev in Denmark developed their own versions of structural and functional linguistics . According to structural theory in anthropology and social anthropology , meaning is produced and reproduced within a culture through various practices, phenomena, and activities that serve as systems of signification. A structuralist approach may study activities as diverse as food-preparation and serving rituals, religious rites, games, literary and non-literary texts, and other forms of entertainment to discover the deep structures by which meaning is produced and reproduced within the culture.

For example, Lévi-Strauss analysed in the 1950s cultural phenomena including mythology, kinship (the alliance theory and the incest taboo ), and food preparation. In addition to these studies, he produced more linguistically-focused writings in which he applied Saussure's distinction between langue and parole in his search for the fundamental structures of the human mind, arguing that the structures that form the \"deep grammar\" of society originate in the mind and operate in people unconsciously. Lévi-Strauss took inspiration from mathematics . [ 10 ] Another concept used in structural anthropology came from the Prague school of linguistics , where Roman Jakobson and others analysed sounds based on the presence or absence of certain features (e.g., voiceless vs. voiced). Lévi-Strauss included this in his conceptualization of the universal structures of the mind, which he held to operate based on pairs of binary oppositions such as hot-cold, male-female, culture-nature, cooked-raw, or marriageable vs. tabooed women. A third influence came from Marcel Mauss (1872–1950), who had written on gift-exchange systems. Based on Mauss, for instance, Lévi-Strauss argued an alliance theory —that kinship systems are based on the exchange of women between groups—as opposed to the ' descent'-based theory described by Edward Evans-Pritchard and Meyer Fortes . While replacing Mauss at his Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes chair, the writings of Lévi-Strauss became widely popular in the 1960s and 1970s and gave rise to the term \"structuralism\" itself.

In the United States, authors such as Marshall Sahlins and James Boon built on structuralism to provide their own analysis of human society. Structural anthropology fell out of favour in the early 1980s for a number of reasons. D'Andrade suggests that this was because it made unverifiable assumptions about the universal structures of the human mind. Authors such as Eric Wolf argued that political economy and colonialism should be at the forefront of anthropology. More generally, criticisms of structuralism by Pierre Bourdieu led to a concern with how cultural and social structures were changed by human agency and practice, a trend which Sherry Ortner has referred to as ' practice theory '. One example is Douglas E. Foley's Learning Capitalist Culture (2010), in which he applied a mixture of structural and Marxist theories to his ethnographic fieldwork among high school students in Texas. Foley analyzed how they reach a shared goal through the lens of social solidarity when he observed \"Mexicanos\" and \"Anglo-Americans\" come together on the same football team to defeat the school's rivals.

They proposed a kind of neuroanthropology which would lay the foundations for a more complete scientific account of cultural similarity and variation by requiring an integration of cultural anthropology and neuroscience —a program that theorists such as Victor Turner also embraced. In literary theory , structuralist criticism relates literary texts to a larger structure, which may be a particular genre , a range of intertextual connections (such as patterns of metaphor [ 12 ] ), a model of a universal narrative structure , or a system of recurrent patterns or motifs. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] The field of structuralist semiotics argues that there must be a structure in every text, which explains why it is easier for experienced readers than for non-experienced readers to interpret a text. [ 15 ] Everything that is written seems to be governed by rules, or \"grammar of literature\", that one learns in educational institutions and that are to be unmasked. [ 16 ] A potential problem for a structuralist interpretation is that it can be highly reductive; as scholar Catherine Belsey puts it: \"the structuralist danger of collapsing all difference.\" [ 17 ] An example of such a reading might be if a student concludes the authors of West Side Story did not write anything \"really\" new, because their work has the same structure as Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet .

In both texts a girl and a boy fall in love (a \"formula\" with a symbolic operator between them would be \"Boy + Girl\") despite the fact that they belong to two groups that hate each other (\"Boy's Group - Girl's Group\" or \"Opposing forces\") and conflict is resolved by their deaths. Structuralist readings focus on how the structures of the single text resolve inherent narrative tensions. If a structuralist reading focuses on multiple texts, there must be some way in which those texts unify themselves into a coherent system. The versatility of structuralism is such that a literary critic could make the same claim about a story of two friendly families (\"Boy's Family + Girl's Family\") that arrange a marriage between their children despite the fact that the children hate each other (\"Boy - Girl\") and then the children commit suicide to escape the arranged marriage; the justification is that the second story's structure is an 'inversion' of the first story's structure: the relationship between the values of love and the two pairs of parties involved have been reversed. Structuralist literary criticism argues that the \"literary banter of a text\" can lie only in new structure, rather than in the specifics of character development and voice in which that structure is expressed. Literary structuralism often follows the lead of Vladimir Propp , Algirdas Julien Greimas , and Claude Lévi-Strauss in seeking out basic deep elements in stories, myths , and more recently, anecdotes, which are combined in various ways to produce the many versions of the ur-story or ur-myth.

There is considerable similarity between structural literary theory and Northrop Frye 's archetypal criticism , which is also indebted to the anthropological study of myths. Some critics have also tried to apply the theory to individual works, but the effort to find unique structures in individual literary works runs counter to the structuralist program and has an affinity with New Criticism . Yifu Lin criticizes early structural economic systems and theories, discussing the failures of it. He writes: \"The structuralism believes that the failure to develop advanced capital-intensive industries spontaneously in a developing country is due to market failures caused by various structural rigidities...\" \"According to neoliberalism, the main reason for the failure of developing countries to catch up with developed countries was too much state intervention in the market, causing misallocation of resources, rent seeking and so forth.\" Rather these failures are more so centered around the unlikelihood of such quick development of these advanced industries within developing countries. [ 18 ] New structural economics is an economic development strategy developed by World Bank Chief Economist Justin Yifu Lin . The strategy combines ideas from both neoclassical economics and structural economics. NSE studies two parts: the base and the superstructure . A base is a combination of forces and relations of production, consisting of, but not limited to, industry and technology, while the superstructure consists of hard infrastructure and institutions. This results in an explanation of how the base impacts the superstructure which then determines transaction costs . [ 19"

Structuralism has often been criticized for being ahistorical and for favouring deterministic structural forces over the ability of people to act . As the political turbulence of the 1960s and 1970s (particularly the student uprisings of May 1968 ) began affecting academia, issues of power and political struggle moved to the center of public attention. [ 20 ] In the 1980s, deconstruction —and its emphasis on the fundamental ambiguity of language rather than its logical structure—became popular. By the end of the century, structuralism was seen as a historically important school of thought , but the movements that it spawned, rather than structuralism itself, commanded attention. [ 21 ] Several social theorists and academics have strongly criticized structuralism or even dismissed it. French hermeneutic philosopher Paul Ricœur (1969) criticized Lévi-Strauss for overstepping the limits of validity of the structuralist approach, ending up in what Ricœur described as \"a Kantianism without a transcendental subject .\" [ 22 ] Anthropologist Adam Kuper (1973) argued that: [ 23 ] 'Structuralism' came to have something of the momentum of a millennial movement and some of its adherents felt that they formed a secret society of the seeing in a world of the blind.

It emerged in the mid-20th century as a skeptical response to modernism , emphasizing the instability of meaning, rejection of universal truths , and critique of grand narratives . While its definition varies across disciplines, it commonly involves skepticism toward established norms, blending of styles, and attention to the socially constructed nature of knowledge and reality. The term began to acquire its current range of meanings in literary criticism and architectural theory during the 1950s–1960s. In opposition to modernism's alleged self-seriousness, postmodernism is characterized by its playful use of eclectic styles and performative irony , among other features, notably pluralism and skepticism . Critics claim it supplants moral , political , and aesthetic ideals with mere style and spectacle. In the 1990s, \"postmodernism\" came to denote a generally celebratory response to cultural pluralism . Proponents align themselves with feminism , multiculturalism , and postcolonialism . Building upon poststructural theory, postmodern thought defined itself by the rejection of any single, foundational historical narrative. This called into question the legitimacy of the Enlightenment account of progress and rationality. Critics allege that its premises lead to a nihilistic form of relativism . In this sense, it has become a term of abuse in popular culture . Historically, it arose alongside industrialization , globalization , and cultural upheaval, with early uses in art and literature evolving into philosophical and social theory through figures like Lyotard , Derrida , Foucault , Baudrillard , and Jameson . In practice, postmodernism manifests in arts, architecture, literature, music, dance, theater, fashion, marketing, and academic fields by embracing plurality, pastiche , reflexivity, and relativism .

[ 15 ] According to scholar Louis Menand , \"Postmodernism is the Swiss Army knife of critical concepts. It's definitionally overloaded, and it can do almost any job you need done.\" [ 16 ] From an opposing perspective, media theorist Dick Hebdige criticized the vagueness of the term, enumerating a long list of otherwise unrelated concepts that people have designated as postmodernism, from \"the décor of a room\" or \"a 'scratch' video\", to fear of nuclear armageddon and the \"implosion of meaning\", and stated that anything that could signify all of those things was \"a buzzword\".

Modernism emerged in the late 1800s, seeking to redefine fundamental truths and values through a radical rethinking of traditional ideas and forms across many fields.

Jencks makes the point that postmodernism (like modernism) varies for each field of art, and that for architecture it is not just a reaction to modernism but what he terms double coding : \"Double Coding: the combination of Modern techniques with something else (usually traditional building) in order for architecture to communicate with the public and a concerned minority, usually other architects.\" [ 89 ] In their book, \"Revisiting Postmodernism\", Terry Farrell and Adam Furman argue that postmodernism brought a more joyous and sensual experience to the culture, particularly in architecture.

[ 91 ] The term \"postmodern dance\" is most strongly associated with the Judson Dance Theater , located in New York's Greenwich Village during the 1960s and 1970s. Perhaps its most important principle is taken from the composer John Cage 's efforts to break down the distinction between art and life, [ 92 ] [ 93 ] developed in particular by the American dancer and choreographer Merce Cunningham , Cage's partner. [ 93 ] The Judson dancers \"[stripped] dance of its theatrical conventions such as virtuoso technique, fanciful costumes, complex storylines, and the traditional stage [and] drew on everyday movements (sitting, walking, kneeling, and other gestures) to create their pieces, often performing them in ordinary spaces.\" [ 94 ] Anna Halprin 's San Francisco Dancers' Workshop, established in the 1950s to explore beyond the technical constraints of modern dance, pioneered ideas later developed at Judson; [ 95 ] Halprin, Simone Forti , and Yvonne Rainer are considered \"giants of the field\".

    "text": "Pragmatism is a philosophical tradition that views language and thought as tools for prediction , problem solving , and action , rather than describing, representing, or mirroring reality . Pragmatists contend that most philosophical topics—such as the nature of knowledge, language, concepts, meaning, belief, and science—are best viewed in terms of their practical uses and successes. Pragmatism began in the United States in the 1870s. Its origins are often attributed to philosophers Charles Sanders Peirce , William James and John Dewey . In 1878, Peirce described it in his pragmatic maxim : \"Consider the practical effects of the objects of your conception. Then, your conception of those effects is the whole of your conception of the object.\" [ 1 ] Pragmatism as a philosophical movement began in the United States around 1870. [ 2 ] Charles Sanders Peirce (and his pragmatic maxim) is given credit for its development, [ 3 ] along with later 20th-century contributors, William James and John Dewey. [ 4 ] Its direction was determined by The Metaphysical Club members Peirce, Dewey, James, Chauncey Wright and George Herbert Mead . The word pragmatic has existed in English since the 1500s, borrowed from French and derived from Greek via Latin. The Greek word pragma , meaning business, deed or act, is a noun derived from the verb prassein , to do. [ 5 ] The first use in print of the name pragmatism was in 1898 by James, who credited Peirce with coining the term during the early 1870s. [ 6 ] James regarded Peirce's \"Illustrations of the Logic of Science\" series—including \" The Fixation of Belief \" (1877), and especially \" How to Make Our Ideas Clear \" (1878)—as the foundation of pragmatism.

Peirce wrote that \"from this definition, pragmatism is scarce more than a corollary; so that I am disposed to think of him as the grandfather of pragmatism\". John Shook has said, \"Chauncey Wright also deserves considerable credit, for as both Peirce and James recall, it was Wright who demanded a phenomenalist and fallibilist empiricism as an alternative to rationalistic speculation.\" [ 10 ] Peirce developed the idea that inquiry depends on real doubt, not mere verbal or hyperbolic doubt , [ 11 ] and said that, in order to understand a conception in a fruitful way, \"Consider the practical effects of the objects of your conception. Then, your conception of those effects is the whole of your conception of the object\", [ 1 ] which he later called the pragmatic maxim . It equates any conception of an object to the general extent of the conceivable implications for informed practice of that object's effects. This is the heart of his pragmatism as a method of experimentational mental reflection arriving at conceptions in terms of conceivable confirmatory and disconfirmatory circumstances—a method hospitable to the generation of explanatory hypotheses, and conducive to the employment and improvement of verification.

[ 12 ] Peirce lectured and further wrote on pragmatism to make clear his own interpretation. While framing a conception's meaning in terms of conceivable tests, Peirce emphasized that, since a conception is general, its meaning, its intellectual purport, equates to its acceptance's implications for general practice, rather than to any definite set of real effects (or test results); a conception's clarified meaning points toward its conceivable verifications, but the outcomes are not meanings, but individual upshots. Peirce in 1905 coined the new name pragmaticism \"for the precise purpose of expressing the original definition\", [ 13 ] saying that \"all went happily\" with James's and F. C. S. Schiller 's variant uses of the old name \"pragmatism\" and that he nonetheless coined the new name because of the old name's growing use in \"literary journals, where it gets abused\".

Inspired by the work of Quine and Sellars, a brand of pragmatism known sometimes as neopragmatism gained influence through Richard Rorty , the most influential of the late 20th century pragmatists along with Hilary Putnam and Robert Brandom . Contemporary pragmatism may be broadly divided into a strict analytic tradition and a \"neo-classical\" pragmatism (such as Susan Haack ) that adheres to the work of Peirce, James, and Dewey. [ citation needed ] A few of the various but often interrelated positions characteristic of philosophers working from a pragmatist approach include: Dewey in The Quest for Certainty criticized what he called \"the philosophical fallacy\": Philosophers often take categories (such as the mental and the physical) for granted because they don't realize that these are nominal concepts that were invented to help solve specific problems. [ 16 ] This causes metaphysical and conceptual confusion. Various examples are the \" ultimate Being \" of Hegelian philosophers, the belief in a \" realm of value \", the idea that logic, because it is an abstraction from concrete thought, has nothing to do with the action of concrete thinking. David L. Hildebrand summarized the problem: \"Perceptual inattention to the specific functions comprising inquiry led realists and idealists alike to formulate accounts of knowledge that project the products of extensive abstraction back onto experience.\" [ 16 ] : 40 From the outset, pragmatists wanted to reform philosophy and bring it"

They argued that idealist and realist philosophy had a tendency to present human knowledge as something beyond what science could grasp. They held that these philosophies then resorted either to a phenomenology inspired by Kant or to correspondence theories of knowledge and truth . [ citation needed ] Pragmatists criticized the former for its a priorism , and the latter because it takes correspondence as an unanalyzable fact. Pragmatism instead tries to explain the relation between knower and known. In 1868, [ 17 ] C.S. Peirce argued that there is no power of intuition in the sense of a cognition unconditioned by inference, and no power of introspection, intuitive or otherwise, and that awareness of an internal world is by hypothetical inference from external facts. Introspection and intuition were staple philosophical tools at least since Descartes. He argued that there is no absolutely first cognition in a cognitive process; such a process has its beginning but can always be analyzed into finer cognitive stages. That which we call introspection does not give privileged access to knowledge about the mind—the self is a concept that is derived from our interaction with the external world and not the other way around.

[ 20 ] This is an important point of disagreement with most other pragmatists, who advocate a more thorough naturalism and psychologism. Richard Rorty expanded on these and other arguments in Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature in which he criticized attempts by many philosophers of science to carve out a space for epistemology that is entirely unrelated to—and sometimes thought of as superior to—the empirical sciences. W.V. Quine , who was instrumental in bringing naturalized epistemology back into favor with his essay \"Epistemology Naturalized\", [ 21 ] also criticized \"traditional\" epistemology and its \"Cartesian dream\" of absolute certainty. The dream, he argued, was impossible in practice as well as misguided in theory, because it separates epistemology from scientific inquiry. Hilary Putnam has suggested that the reconciliation of anti-skepticism [ 25 ] and fallibilism is the central goal of American pragmatism.

[ 27 ] Doubt, like belief, requires justification. Genuine doubt irritates and inhibits, in the sense that belief is that upon which one is prepared to act. [ 1 ] It arises from confrontation with some specific recalcitrant matter of fact (which Dewey called a \"situation\"), which unsettles our belief in some specific proposition. Inquiry is then the rationally self-controlled process of attempting to return to a settled state of belief about the matter. Note that anti-skepticism is a reaction to modern academic skepticism in the wake of Descartes. The pragmatist insistence that all knowledge is tentative is quite congenial to the older skeptical tradition. Pragmatism was not the first to apply evolution to theories of knowledge: Schopenhauer advocated a biological idealism as what's useful to an organism to believe might differ wildly from what is true. Here knowledge and action are portrayed as two separate spheres with an absolute or transcendental truth above and beyond any sort of inquiry organisms used to cope with life. Pragmatism challenges this idealism by providing an \"ecological\" account of knowledge: inquiry is how organisms can get a grip on their environment. Real and true are functional labels in inquiry and cannot be understood outside of this context."

[ citation needed ] Many of James' best-turned phrases—\"truth's cash value\" [ 28 ] and \"the true is only the expedient in our way of thinking\" [ 29 ] —were taken out of context and caricatured in contemporary literature as representing the view where any idea with practical utility is true. William James wrote: It is high time to urge the use of a little imagination in philosophy. The unwillingness of some of our critics to read any but the silliest of possible meanings into our statements is as discreditable to their imaginations as anything I know in recent philosophic history. Schiller says the truth is that which \"works.\" Thereupon he is treated as one who limits verification to the lowest material utilities. Dewey says truth is what gives \"satisfaction\"! He is treated as one who believes in calling everything true which, if it were true, would be pleasant. [ 30 ] In reality, James asserts, the theory is a great deal more subtle.

Is it only in the struggle of intelligent organisms with the surrounding environment that beliefs acquire meaning? Does a belief only become true when it succeeds in this struggle? In James's pragmatism nothing practical or useful is held to be necessarily true nor is anything which helps to survive merely in the short term. For example, to believe my cheating spouse is faithful may help me feel better now, but it is certainly not useful from a more long-term perspective because it doesn't accord with the facts (and is therefore not true). While pragmatism started simply as a criterion of meaning, it quickly expanded to become a full-fledged epistemology with wide-ranging implications for the entire philosophical field. Pragmatists who work in these fields share a common inspiration, but their work is diverse and there are no received views. In the philosophy of science, instrumentalism is the view that concepts and theories are merely useful instruments and progress in science cannot be couched in terms of concepts and theories somehow mirroring reality. Instrumentalist philosophers often define scientific progress as nothing more than an improvement in explaining and predicting phenomena. Instrumentalism does not state that truth does not matter, but rather provides a specific answer to the question of what truth and falsity mean and how they function in science. One of C. I.

Lewis' own development of multiple modal logics is a case in point. Lewis is sometimes called a proponent of conceptual pragmatism because of this. [ 32 ] Another development is the cooperation of logical positivism and pragmatism in the works of Charles W. Morris and Rudolf Carnap . The influence of pragmatism on these writers is mostly limited to the incorporation of the pragmatic maxim into their epistemology. Pragmatists with a broader conception of the movement do not often refer to them. W. V. Quine 's paper \" Two Dogmas of Empiricism \", published in 1951, is one of the most celebrated papers of 20th-century philosophy in the analytic tradition. The paper is an attack on two central tenets of the logical positivists' philosophy. One is the distinction between analytic statements (tautologies and contradictions) whose truth (or falsehood) is a function of the meanings of the words in the statement ('all bachelors are unmarried'), and synthetic statements, whose truth (or falsehood) is a function of (contingent) states of affairs. The other is reductionism, the theory that each meaningful statement gets its meaning from some logical construction of terms which refers exclusively to immediate experience.

Later in his life Schiller became famous for his attacks on logic in his textbook, Formal Logic . By then, Schiller's pragmatism had become the nearest of any of the classical pragmatists to an ordinary language philosophy . Schiller sought to undermine the very possibility of formal logic, by showing that words only had meaning when used in context. The least famous of Schiller's main works was the constructive sequel to his destructive book Formal Logic . In this sequel, Logic for Use , Schiller attempted to construct a new logic to replace the formal logic that he had criticized in Formal Logic . What he offers is something philosophers would recognize today as a logic covering the context of discovery and the hypothetico-deductive method. Whereas Schiller dismissed the possibility of formal logic, most pragmatists are critical rather of its pretension to ultimate validity and see logic as one logical tool among others—or perhaps, considering the multitude of formal logics, one set of tools among others. This is the view of C. I. Lewis. C. S. Peirce developed multiple methods for doing formal logic. Stephen Toulmin 's The Uses of Argument inspired scholars in informal logic and rhetoric studies (although it is an epistemological work). James and Dewey were empirical thinkers in the most straightforward fashion: experience is the ultimate test and experience is what needs to be explained.

Radical empiricism , or Immediate Empiricism in Dewey's words, wants to give a place to meaning and value instead of explaining them away as subjective additions to a world of whizzing atoms. William James gives an interesting example of this philosophical shortcoming: [A young graduate] began by saying that he had always taken for granted that when you entered a philosophic classroom you had to open relations with a universe entirely distinct from the one you left behind you in the street. The two were supposed, he said, to have so little to do with each other, that you could not possibly occupy your mind with them at the same time. The world of concrete personal experiences to which the street belongs is multitudinous beyond imagination, tangled, muddy, painful and perplexed. The world to which your philosophy-professor introduces you is simple, clean and noble. The contradictions of real life are absent from it. ... In point of fact it is far less an account of this actual world than a clear addition built upon it ... It is no explanation of our concrete universe [ 33 ] F. C. S.

Schiller 's first book Riddles of the Sphinx was published before he became aware of the growing pragmatist movement taking place in America. In it, Schiller argues for a middle ground between materialism and absolute metaphysics. These opposites are comparable to what William James called tough-minded empiricism and tender-minded rationalism. Schiller contends on the one hand that mechanistic naturalism cannot make sense of the \"higher\" aspects of our world. These include free will, consciousness, purpose, universals and some would add God. On the other hand, abstract metaphysics cannot make sense of the \"lower\" aspects of our world (e.g. the imperfect, change, physicality). While Schiller is vague about the exact sort of middle ground he is trying to establish, he suggests that metaphysics is a tool that can aid inquiry, but that it is valuable only insofar as it does help in explanation. In the second half of the 20th century, Stephen Toulmin argued that the need to distinguish between reality and appearance only arises within an explanatory scheme and therefore that there is no point in asking what \"ultimate reality\" consists of. More recently, a similar idea has been suggested by the postanalytic philosopher Daniel Dennett , who argues that anyone who wants to understand the world has to acknowledge both the \"syntactical\" aspects of reality (i.e., whizzing atoms) and its emergent or \"semantic\" properties (i.e"

In most countries, the difference between GDP and GNI are modest so that GDP can approximately be treated as total income of all the inhabitants as well, but in some countries, e.g. countries with very large net foreign assets (or debt), the difference may be considerable. [ 8 ] : 385 Advances in technology, accumulation of machinery and other capital , and better education and human capital , are all factors that lead to increased economic output over time. However, output does not always increase consistently over time. Business cycles can cause short-term drops in output called recessions . Economists look for macroeconomic policies that prevent economies from slipping into either recessions or overheating and that lead to higher productivity levels and standards of living . The amount of unemployment in an economy is measured by the unemployment rate, i.e. the percentage of persons in the labor force who do not have a job, but who are actively looking for one. People who are retired, pursuing education, or discouraged from seeking work by a lack of job prospects are not part of the labor force and consequently not counted as unemployed, either.

Okun's law represents the empirical relationship between unemployment and short-run GDP growth. [ 11 ] The original version of Okun's law states that a 3% increase in output would lead to a 1% decrease in unemployment. [ 12 ] The structural or natural rate of unemployment is the level of unemployment that will occur in a medium-run equilibrium, i.e. a situation with a cyclical unemployment rate of zero. There may be several reasons why there is some positive unemployment level even in a cyclically neutral situation, which all have their foundation in some kind of market failure : [ 9 ] A general price increase across the entire economy is called inflation . When prices decrease, there is deflation . Economists measure these changes in prices with price indexes . Inflation will increase when an economy becomes overheated and grows too quickly. Similarly, a declining economy can lead to decreasing inflation and even in some cases deflation. Changes in the inflation level may be the result of several factors. Too much aggregate demand in the economy will cause an overheating , raising inflation rates via the Phillips curve because of a tight labor market leading to large wage increases which will be transmitted to increases in the price of the products of employers. Too little aggregate demand will have the opposite effect of creating more unemployment and lower wages, thereby decreasing inflation. Aggregate supply shocks will also affect inflation, e.g. the oil crises of the 1970s and the 2021–2023 global energy crisis .

Changes in inflation may also impact the formation of inflation expectations , creating a self-fulfilling inflationary or deflationary spiral. [ 8 ] The monetarist quantity theory of money holds that changes in the price level are directly caused by changes in the money supply . [ 19 ] Central bankers conducting monetary policy usually have as a main priority to avoid too high inflation, typically by adjusting interest rates. High inflation as well as deflation can lead to increased uncertainty and other negative consequences, in particular when the inflation (or deflation) is unexpected. Consequently, most central banks aim for a positive, but stable and not very high inflation level. [ 8 ] Whereas there is empirical evidence that there is a long-run positive correlation between the growth rate of the money stock and the rate of inflation, the quantity theory has proved unreliable in the short- and medium-run time horizon relevant to monetary policy and is abandoned as a practical guideline by most central banks today. [ 20 ] One way to capture GDP, or total net output, is the expenditure method. The expenditure approach requires aggregating four main components of spending: consumer spending (CS) government spending (GS), investment (IS), and net exports (EXP-IMP). [ 21 ] CS is composed of household purchases of goods and services, including investments in residential housing. GS is spending by the government on goods and services, particularly things like education , military and other public infrastructure .

IS is all spending by businesses on physical capital or equipment as well as labor, in service of goods and service production. Finally net exports captures a country's balance of trade, such that the total exports are goods and services that a country sells abroad and imports are goods and services purchased by consumers domestically from abroad. Represented as an equation, GDP is: G D P = C S + G S + I S + ( E X P − I M P ) {\\displaystyle GDP=CS+GS+IS+(EXP-IMP)} Macroeconomists are also interested in the measurement of GDP separate from the effects of inflation. Where inflation captures a relative change in price, the expenditure method may misattribute increased spending on goods and services as growth, when it may be driven by a relative change in the price of goods and services as opposed to a change in the total quantity. To parse out these effects, the GDP deflator is a measurement of the relative difference in real vs. nominal GDP, giving us the size of inflation adjustment for a given year.

[ 24 ] A GDP deflator of 100 indicates that there is neither inflation nor deflation. When the value exceeds 100, it is an indication that price inflation is occurring in the economy. And in the reverse, a GDP deflation measure less than 100 indicates deflation. Two common ways of determining the total money supply in an economy are M1 and M2. M2 consists of M1 plus a few other things. M1 is money that is liquid. Liquid refers to a financial asset being able to easily be converted into cash quickly and without losing a significant amount of value. This obviously includes cash but also things like coins, checking account deposits, etc. M2, however, includes time deposits, saving accounts, and money market mutual funds , which are not as liquid, in its measurement. It is important to know about the money supply as it affects interest rates and can also play a central role in monetary policy.

The money supply reserve multiplier equation is: Money multiplier = 1 / reserve requirement ratio [ 26 ] The reserve requirement in this equation represents a proportion of money that the bank is required to keep in case they need to deal with withdrawals from customers. That proportion of money is based on the deposits of money made at the bank. So, if the reserve requirement is .20 (20%), then the money multiplier is five. This means that a $5 deposit would lead to a $25 increase in the money supply. This is because of the cycle of the bank keeping part of the deposit (in our example, 20%) and lending out the rest every time. These new spendable bank deposits are counted in the money supply even though the amount of physical currency did not change. So, while the physical amount of currency would still be $5, the amount of spendable money would be $25. Open economy macroeconomics deals with the consequences of international trade in goods , financial assets and possibly factor markets like labor migration and international relocation of firms (physical capital). It explores what determines import , export , the balance of trade and over longer horizons the accumulation of net foreign assets .

[ 8 ] : 526 In Keynes' theory, aggregate demand - by Keynes called \"effective demand\" - was key to determining output. Even if Keynes conceded that output might eventually return to a medium-run equilibrium (or \"potential\") level, the process would be slow at best. Keynes coined the term liquidity preference (his preferred name for what is also known as money demand ) and explained how monetary policy might affect aggregate demand, at the same time offering clear policy recommendations for an active role of fiscal policy in stabilizing aggregate demand and hence output and employment. In addition, he explained how the multiplier effect would magnify a small decrease in consumption or investment and cause declines throughout the economy, and noted the role that uncertainty and animal spirits can play in the economy. [ 8 ] : 526 The generation following Keynes combined the macroeconomics of the General Theory with neoclassical microeconomics to create the neoclassical synthesis .

He argued that the role of money in the economy was sufficient to explain the Great Depression , and that aggregate demand oriented explanations were not necessary. Friedman also argued that monetary policy was more effective than fiscal policy; however, Friedman doubted the government's ability to \"fine-tune\" the economy with monetary policy. He generally favored a policy of steady growth in money supply instead of frequent intervention. [ 8 ] : 528 Friedman also challenged the original simple Phillips curve relationship between inflation and unemployment. Friedman and Edmund Phelps (who was not a monetarist) proposed an \"augmented\" version of the Phillips curve that excluded the possibility of a stable, long-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment.

Monetarism was particularly influential in the early 1980s, but fell out of favor when central banks found the results disappointing when trying to target money supply instead of interest rates as monetarists recommended, concluding that the relationships between money growth, inflation and real GDP growth are too unstable to be useful in practical monetary policy making.

Prior to Lucas, economists had generally used adaptive expectations where agents were assumed to look at the recent past to make expectations about the future. Under rational expectations, agents are assumed to be more sophisticated. [ 8 ] : 530 Consumers will not simply assume a 2% inflation rate just because that has been the average the past few years; they will look at current monetary policy and economic conditions to make an informed forecast. In the new classical models with rational expectations, monetary policy only had a limited impact. Lucas also made an influential critique of Keynesian empirical models. He argued that forecasting models based on empirical relationships would keep producing the same predictions even as the underlying model generating the data changed. He advocated models based on fundamental economic theory (i.e. having an explicit microeconomic foundation ) that would, in principle, be structurally accurate as economies changed.

In order to generate macroeconomic fluctuations, RBC models explained recessions and unemployment with changes in technology instead of changes in the markets for goods or money.

New Keynesian models investigated sources of sticky prices and wages due to imperfect competition , [ 31 ] which would not adjust, allowing monetary policy to impact quantities instead of prices.

One goal of microeconomics is to analyze the market mechanisms that establish relative prices among goods and services and allocate limited resources among alternative uses. [ 4 ] Microeconomics shows conditions under which free markets lead to desirable allocations. It also analyzes market failure , where markets fail to produce efficient results. [ 5 ] While microeconomics focuses on firms and individuals, macroeconomics focuses on the total of economic activity, dealing with the issues of growth , inflation , and unemployment —and with national policies relating to these issues.

The technical assumption that preference relations are continuous is needed to ensure the existence of a utility function . Although microeconomic theory can continue without this assumption, it would make comparative statics impossible since there is no guarantee that the resulting utility function would be differentiable . Microeconomic theory progresses by defining a competitive budget set which is a subset of the consumption set . It is at this point that economists make the technical assumption that preferences are locally non-satiated . Without the assumption of LNS (local non-satiation) there is no 100% guarantee but there would be a rational rise [ 8 ] in individual utility . With the necessary tools and assumptions in place the utility maximization problem (UMP) is developed. The utility maximization problem is the heart of consumer theory . The utility maximization problem attempts to explain the action axiom by imposing rationality axioms on consumer preferences and then mathematically modeling and analyzing the consequences. [ 9 ] The utility maximization problem serves not only as the mathematical foundation of consumer theory but as a metaphysical explanation of it as well. That is, the utility maximization problem is used by economists to not only explain what or how individuals make choices but why individuals make choices as well.

Economists call the solution to the utility maximization problem a Walrasian demand function or correspondence. [ 10 ] The utility maximization problem has so far been developed by taking consumer tastes (i.e. consumer utility) as primitive. However, an alternative way to develop microeconomic theory is by taking consumer choice as primitive. This model of microeconomic theory is referred to as revealed preference theory. The theory of supply and demand usually assumes that markets are perfectly competitive . This implies that there are many buyers and sellers in the market and none of them have the capacity to significantly influence prices of goods and services. In many real-life transactions, the assumption fails because some individual buyers or sellers have the ability to influence prices. Quite often, a sophisticated analysis is required to understand the demand-supply equation of a good model. However, the theory works well in situations meeting these assumptions. Mainstream economics does not assume a priori that markets are preferable to other forms of social organization. In fact, much analysis is devoted to cases where market failures lead to resource allocation that is suboptimal and creates deadweight loss . A classic example of suboptimal resource allocation is that of a public good . In such cases, economists may attempt to find policies that avoid waste, either directly by government control, indirectly by regulation that induces market participants to act in a manner consistent with optimal welfare, or by creating \" missing markets"

This is studied in the field of collective action and public choice theory . \"Optimal welfare\" usually takes on a Paretian norm, which is a mathematical application of the Kaldor–Hicks method . This can diverge from the Utilitarian goal of maximizing utility because it does not consider the distribution of goods between people. Market failure in positive economics (microeconomics) is limited in implications without mixing the belief of the economist and their theory. The demand for various commodities by individuals is generally thought of as the outcome of a utility-maximizing process, with each individual trying to maximize their own utility under a budget constraint and a given consumption set. Individuals and firms need to allocate limited resources to ensure all agents in the economy are well off. Firms decide which goods and services to produce considering low costs involving labour, materials and capital as well as potential profit margins. Consumers choose the good and services they want that will maximize their happiness taking into account their limited wealth. [ 11 ] The government can make these allocation decisions or they can be independently made by the consumers and firms.

It is a way of analyzing how consumers may achieve equilibrium between preferences and expenditures by maximizing utility subject to consumer budget constraints .

Some economists define production broadly as all economic activity other than consumption . They see every commercial activity other than the final purchase as some form of production. The cost-of-production theory of value states that the price of an object or condition is determined by the sum of the cost of the resources that went into making it. The cost can comprise any of the factors of production (including labor , capital , or land ) and taxation. Technology can be viewed either as a form of fixed capital (e.g. an industrial plant ) or circulating capital (e.g. intermediate goods ). In the mathematical model for the cost of production, the short-run total cost is equal to fixed cost plus total variable cost . The fixed cost refers to the cost that is incurred regardless of how much the firm produces. The variable cost is a function of the quantity of an object being produced. The cost function can be used to characterize production through the duality theory in economics, developed mainly by Ronald Shephard (1953, 1970) and other scholars (Sickles & Zelenyuk, 2019, ch. 2). Over a short time period (few months), most costs are fixed costs as the firm will have to pay for salaries, contracted shipment and materials used to produce various goods. Over a longer time period (2-3 years), costs can become variable. Firms can decide to reduce output, purchase fewer materials and even sell some machinery.

Over 10 years, most costs become variable as workers can be laid off or new machinery can be bought to replace the old machinery [ 17 ] Sunk costs – This is a fixed cost that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered. An example of this can be in R&D development like in the pharmaceutical industry. Hundreds of millions of dollars are spent to achieve new drug breakthroughs but this is challenging as its increasingly harder to find new breakthroughs and meet tighter regulation standards. Thus many projects are written off leading to losses of millions of dollars [ 18 ] Opportunity cost is closely related to the idea of time constraints. One can do only one thing at a time, which means that, inevitably, one is always giving up other things. The opportunity cost of any activity is the value of the next-best alternative thing one may have done instead. Opportunity cost depends only on the value of the next-best alternative. It does not matter whether one has five alternatives or 5,000. Opportunity costs can tell when not to do something as well as when to do something. For example, one may like waffles, but like chocolate even more. If someone offers only waffles, one would take it. But if offered waffles or chocolate, one would take the chocolate. The opportunity cost of eating waffles is sacrificing the chance to eat chocolate. Because the cost of not eating the chocolate is higher than the benefits of eating the waffles, it makes no sense to choose waffles. Of course, if one chooses chocolate, they are still faced with the opportunity cost of giving up having waffles."

Of course, if one chooses chocolate, they are still faced with the opportunity cost of giving up having waffles. But one is willing to do that because the waffle's opportunity cost is lower than the benefits of the chocolate. Opportunity costs are unavoidable constraints on behavior because one has to decide what's best and give up the next-best alternative. Microeconomics is also known as price theory to highlight the significance of prices in relation to buyer and sellers as these agents determine prices due to their individual actions. [ 11 ] Price theory is a field of economics that uses the supply and demand framework to explain and predict human behavior. It is associated with the Chicago School of Economics . Price theory studies competitive equilibrium in markets to yield testable hypotheses that can be rejected. Price theory is not the same as microeconomics. Strategic behavior, such as the interactions among sellers in a market where they are few, is a significant part of microeconomics but is not emphasized in price theory. Price theorists focus on competition believing it to be a reasonable description of most markets that leaves room to study additional aspects of tastes and technology. As a result, price theory tends to use less game theory than microeconomics does. Price theory focuses on how agents respond to prices, but its framework can be applied to a wide variety of socioeconomic issues that might not seem to involve prices at first glance. Price theorists have influenced several other fields including developing public choice theory and law and economics . Price theory has been applied to issues previously"

Price theorists have influenced several other fields including developing public choice theory and law and economics . Price theory has been applied to issues previously thought of as outside the purview of economics such as criminal justice, marriage, and addiction. Supply and demand is an economic model of price determination in a perfectly competitive market . It concludes that in a perfectly competitive market with no externalities , per unit taxes , or price controls , the unit price for a particular good is the price at which the quantity demanded by consumers equals the quantity supplied by producers. This price results in a stable economic equilibrium . Prices and quantities have been described as the most directly observable attributes of goods produced and exchanged in a market economy . [ 19 ] The theory of supply and demand is an organizing principle for explaining how prices coordinate the amounts produced and consumed. In microeconomics, it applies to price and output determination for a market with perfect competition , which includes the condition of no buyers or sellers large enough to have price-setting power . For a given market of a commodity , demand is the relation of the quantity that all buyers would be prepared to purchase at each unit price of the good. Demand is often represented by a table or a graph showing price and quantity demanded (as in the figure). Demand theory describes individual consumers as rationally choosing the most preferred quantity of each good, given income, prices, tastes, etc. A term for this is \"constrained utility maximization\" (with income and wealth as the constraints on demand).

Here, utility refers to the hypothesized relation of each individual consumer for ranking different commodity bundles as more or less preferred. The law of demand states that, in general, price and quantity demanded in a given market are inversely related. That is, the higher the price of a product, the less of it people would be prepared to buy (other things unchanged ). As the price of a commodity falls, consumers move toward it from relatively more expensive goods (the substitution effect ). In addition, purchasing power from the price decline increases ability to buy (the income effect ). Other factors can change demand ; for example an increase in income will shift the demand curve for a normal good outward relative to the origin, as in the figure. All determinants are predominantly taken as constant factors of demand and supply. Supply is the relation between the price of a good and the quantity available for sale at that price. It may be represented as a table or graph relating price and quantity supplied. Producers, for example business firms, are hypothesized to be profit maximizers , meaning that they attempt to produce and supply the amount of goods that will bring them the highest profit. Supply is typically represented as a function relating price and quantity, if other factors are unchanged. That is, the higher the price at which the good can be sold, the more of it producers will supply, as in the figure. The higher price makes it profitable to increase production."

Just as on the demand side, the position of the supply can shift, say from a change in the price of a productive input or a technical improvement. The \"Law of Supply\" states that, in general, a rise in price leads to an expansion in supply and a fall in price leads to a contraction in supply. Here as well, the determinants of supply, such as price of substitutes, cost of production, technology applied and various factors of inputs of production are all taken to be constant for a specific time period of evaluation of supply. Market equilibrium occurs where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded, the intersection of the supply and demand curves in the figure above. At a price below equilibrium, there is a shortage of quantity supplied compared to quantity demanded. This is posited to bid the price up. At a price above equilibrium, there is a surplus of quantity supplied compared to quantity demanded. This pushes the price down. The model of supply and demand predicts that for given supply and demand curves, price and quantity will stabilize at the price that makes quantity supplied equal to quantity demanded. Similarly, demand-and-supply theory predicts a new price-quantity combination from a shift in demand (as to the figure), or in supply. For a given quantity of a consumer good, the point on the demand curve indicates the value, or marginal utility , to consumers for that unit.

[ 20 ] The corresponding point on the supply curve measures marginal cost , the increase in total cost to the supplier for the corresponding unit of the good. The price in equilibrium is determined by supply and demand. In a perfectly competitive market , supply and demand equate marginal cost and marginal utility at equilibrium. [ 21 ] On the supply side of the market, some factors of production are described as (relatively) variable in the short run , which affects the cost of changing output levels. Their usage rates can be changed easily, such as electrical power, raw-material inputs, and over-time and temp work. Other inputs are relatively fixed , such as plant and equipment and key personnel. In the long run , all inputs may be adjusted by management . These distinctions translate to differences in the elasticity (responsiveness) of the supply curve in the short and long runs and corresponding differences in the price-quantity change from a shift on the supply or demand side of the market. Marginalist theory , such as above, describes the consumers as attempting to reach most-preferred positions, subject to income and wealth constraints while producers attempt to maximize profits subject to their own constraints, including demand for goods produced, technology, and the price of inputs.

At the point where marginal profit reaches zero, further increases in production of the good stop. For movement to market equilibrium and for changes in equilibrium, price and quantity also change \"at the margin\": more-or-less of something, rather than necessarily all-or-nothing. Other applications of demand and supply include the distribution of income among the factors of production , including labor and capital, through factor markets. In a competitive labor market for example the quantity of labor employed and the price of labor (the wage rate) depends on the demand for labor (from employers for production) and supply of labor (from potential workers). Labor economics examines the interaction of workers and employers through such markets to explain patterns and changes of wages and other labor income, labor mobility , and (un)employment, productivity through human capital , and related public-policy issues.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] : 579 This increase is measured using a price index, typically a consumer price index (CPI). [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation corresponds to a reduction in the purchasing power of money. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] The opposite of inflation is deflation , a decrease in the general price level of goods and services. The common measure of inflation is the inflation rate , the annualized percentage change in a general price index . [ 11 ] : 22–32 Changes in inflation are widely attributed to increases in the money supply , fluctuations in real demand for goods and services (also known as demand shocks , including changes in fiscal or monetary policy ), changes in available supplies such as during energy crises (also known as supply shocks ), significant decreases in interest rates set by the central bank , or changes in inflation expectations, which may be self-fulfilling. [ 4 ] [ 12 ] Moderate inflation affects economies in both positive and negative ways. The negative effects would include an increase in the opportunity cost of holding money; uncertainty over future inflation, which may discourage investment and savings; and, if inflation were rapid enough, shortages of goods as consumers begin hoarding out of concern that prices will increase in the future.

Positive effects include reducing unemployment due to nominal wage rigidity , [ 11 ] : 238–255 allowing the central bank greater freedom in carrying out monetary policy , encouraging loans and investment instead of money hoarding, and avoiding the inefficiencies associated with deflation. Today, most economists favour a low and steady rate of inflation. Low (as opposed to zero or negative ) inflation reduces the likelihood of economic recessions by enabling the labor market to adjust more quickly and reduces the risk that a liquidity trap prevents monetary policy from stabilizing the economy, while also avoiding the costs associated with high inflation. [ 13 ] The task of keeping the rate of inflation low and stable is usually given to central banks that control monetary policy, normally through the setting of interest rates and by carrying out open market operations . [ 12 ] The term originates from the Latin inflare (to blow into or inflate). Conceptually, inflation refers to the general trend of prices, not changes in any specific price. For example, if people choose to buy more cucumbers than tomatoes, cucumbers consequently become more expensive and tomatoes less expensive. These changes are not related to inflation; they reflect a shift in tastes. Inflation is related to the value of currency itself. When currency was linked with gold, if new gold deposits were found, the price of gold and the value of currency would fall, and consequently, the prices of all other goods would become higher.

Following the proliferation of private banknote currency printed during the American Civil War , the term \"inflation\" started to appear as a direct reference to the currency depreciation that occurred as the quantity of redeemable banknotes outstripped the quantity of metal available for their redemption. At that time, the term inflation referred to the devaluation of the currency, and not to a rise in the price of goods. [ 15 ] This relationship between the over-supply of banknotes and a resulting depreciation in their value was noted by earlier classical economists such as David Hume and David Ricardo , who would go on to examine and debate what effect a currency devaluation has on the price of goods. [ 16 ] Other economic concepts related to inflation include: deflation – a fall in the general price level; [ 17 ] disinflation – a decrease in the rate of inflation; [ 18 ] hyperinflation – an out-of-control inflationary spiral; [ 19 ] stagflation – a combination of inflation, slow economic growth and high unemployment; [ 20 ] reflation – an attempt to raise the general level of prices to counteract deflationary pressures; [ 21 ] asset price inflation – a general rise in the prices of financial assets without a corresponding increase"

One of the earliest documented inflations occurred in Alexander the Great 's empire 330 BC.

However, when large, prolonged infusions of gold or silver into an economy occurred, this could lead to long periods of inflation.

By diluting the silver with other metals, the government could issue more coins without increasing the amount of silver used to make them. When the cost of each coin is lowered in this way, the government profits from an increase in seigniorage . [ 33 ] This practice would increase the money supply but at the same time the relative value of each coin would be lowered. As the relative value of the coins becomes lower, consumers would need to give more coins in exchange for the same goods and services as before. These goods and services would experience a price increase as the value of each coin is reduced.

Since the Great Depression, however, there has been a general tendency for prices to rise every year.

Inflation is politically driven, and policy can directly influence the trend of inflation. The RPI is indicative of the experiences of a wide range of household types, particularly low-income households. [ 49 ] To illustrate the method of calculation, in January 2007, the U.S. Consumer Price Index was 202.416, and in January 2008 it was 211.080. The formula for calculating the annual percentage rate inflation in the CPI over the course of the year is: ( 211.080 − 202.416 202.416 ) × 100 % = 4.28 % {\\displaystyle \\left({\\frac {211.080-202.416}{202.416}}\\right)\\times 100\\%=4.28\\%} The resulting inflation rate for the CPI in this one-year period is 4.28%, meaning the general level of prices for typical U.S. consumers rose by approximately four percent in 2007.

This includes: Measuring inflation in an economy requires objective means of differentiating changes in nominal prices on a common set of goods and services, and distinguishing them from those price shifts resulting from changes in value such as volume, quality, or performance.

For example, if the price of a can of corn changes from $0.90 to $1.00 over the course of a year, with no change in quality, then this price difference represents inflation. This single price change would not, however, represent general inflation in an overall economy. Overall inflation is measured as the price change of a large \"basket\" of representative goods and services. This is the purpose of a price index , which is the combined price of a \"basket\" of many goods and services. The combined price is the sum of the weighted prices of items in the \"basket\". A weighted price is calculated by multiplying the unit price of an item by the number of that item the average consumer purchases. Weighted pricing is necessary to measure the effect of individual unit price changes on the economy's overall inflation. The consumer price index , for example, uses data collected by surveying households to determine what proportion of the typical consumer's overall spending is spent on specific goods and services, and weights the average prices of those items accordingly. Those weighted average prices are combined to calculate the overall price. To better relate price changes over time, indexes typically choose a \"base year\" price and assign it a value of 100. Index prices in subsequent years are then expressed in relation to the base year price.

Inflation measures are often modified over time, either for the relative weight of goods in the basket, or in the way in which goods and services from the present are compared with goods and services from the past. Basket weights are updated regularly, usually every year, to adapt to changes in consumer behavior. Sudden changes in consumer behavior can still introduce a weighting bias in inflation measurement. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic it has been shown that the basket of goods and services was no longer representative of consumption during the crisis, as numerous goods and services could no longer be consumed due to government containment measures (\"lock-downs\"). [ 57 ] [ 58 ] Over time, adjustments are also made to the type of goods and services selected to reflect changes in the sorts of goods and services purchased by 'typical consumers'. New products may be introduced, older products disappear, the quality of existing products may change, and consumer preferences can shift. Different segments of the population may naturally consume different \"baskets\" of goods and services and may even experience different inflation rates. It is argued that companies have put more innovation into bringing down prices for wealthy families than for poor families. [ 59 ] Inflation numbers are often seasonally adjusted to differentiate expected cyclical cost shifts. For example, home heating costs are expected to rise in colder months, and seasonal adjustments are often used when measuring inflation to compensate for cyclical energy or fuel demand spikes. Inflation numbers may be averaged or otherwise subjected to statistical techniques to remove statistical noise and volatility of individual prices. [ 60 ] [ 61 ] When looking at inflation,"

[ 60 ] [ 61 ] When looking at inflation, economic institutions may focus only on certain kinds of prices, or special indices , such as the core inflation index which is used by central banks to formulate monetary policy . [ 62 ] Most inflation indices are calculated from weighted averages of selected price changes. This necessarily introduces distortion, and can lead to legitimate disputes about what the true inflation rate is. This problem can be overcome by including all available price changes in the calculation, and then choosing the median value. [ 63 ] In some other cases, governments may intentionally report false inflation rates; for instance, during the presidency of Cristina Kirchner (2007–2015) the government of Argentina was criticised for manipulating economic data, such as inflation and GDP figures, for political gain and to reduce payments on its inflation-indexed debt. [ 64 ] [ 65 ] The true inflation is one percentage point lower than the official one, according to research. Therefore, the 2% inflation target is needed to prevent the true inflation being close to zero or even deflation. The reasons are the following: [ 66 ] Nevertheless, people overestimate the inflation even vs. the measured inflation. This is because they focus more on commonly-bought items than on durable goods, and more on price increases than on price decreases.

Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate, which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the labour force (the total number of people employed above a specified age [ 2 ] added to those unemployed) during the reference period . [ 3 ] Unemployment can have many sources, such as the following below: Unemployment and the status of the economy can be influenced by a country through, for example, fiscal policy . Furthermore, the monetary authority of a country, such as the central bank , can influence the availability and cost for money through its monetary policy . In addition to theories of unemployment, a few categorisations of unemployment are used for more precisely modelling the effects of unemployment within the economic system. Some of the main types of unemployment include structural unemployment , frictional unemployment , cyclical unemployment , involuntary unemployment and classical unemployment. [ 4 ] Structural unemployment focuses on foundational problems in the economy and inefficiencies inherent in labor markets, including a mismatch between the supply and demand of laborers with necessary skill sets. Structural arguments emphasize causes and solutions related to disruptive technologies and globalization . Discussions of frictional unemployment focus on voluntary decisions to work based on individuals' valuation of their own work and how that compares to current wage rates added to the time and effort required to find a job. Causes and solutions for frictional unemployment often address job entry threshold and wage rates.

[ 5 ] Because of the difficulty in measuring the unemployment rate by, for example, using surveys (as in the United States ) or through registered unemployed citizens (as in some European countries), statistical figures such as the employment-to-population ratio might be more suitable for evaluating the status of the workforce and the economy if they were based on people who are registered, for example, as taxpayers . [ 6 ] The state of being without any work yet looking for work is called unemployment. Economists distinguish between various overlapping types of and theories of unemployment, including cyclical or Keynesian unemployment , frictional unemployment , structural unemployment and classical unemployment definition. Some additional types of unemployment that are occasionally mentioned are seasonal unemployment, hardcore unemployment, and hidden unemployment. [ 7 ] Though there have been several definitions of \"voluntary\" and \" involuntary unemployment \" in the economics literature, a simple distinction is often applied. Voluntary unemployment is attributed to the individual's decisions, but involuntary unemployment exists because of the socio-economic environment (including the market structure, government intervention, and the level of aggregate demand) in which individuals operate. In these terms, much or most of frictional unemployment is voluntary since it reflects individual search behavior. Voluntary unemployment includes workers who reject low-wage jobs, but involuntary unemployment includes workers fired because of an economic crisis, industrial decline , company bankruptcy, or organizational restructuring.

On the other hand, cyclical unemployment, structural unemployment, and classical unemployment are largely involuntary in nature. However, the existence of structural unemployment may reflect choices made by the unemployed in the past, and classical (natural) unemployment may result from the legislative and economic choices made by labour unions or political parties. The clearest cases of involuntary unemployment are those with fewer job vacancies than unemployed workers even when wages are allowed to adjust and so even if all vacancies were to be filled, some unemployed workers would still remain. That happens with cyclical unemployment, as macroeconomic forces cause microeconomic unemployment, which can boomerang back and exacerbate those macroeconomic forces. Classical, natural, or real-wage unemployment, occurs when real wages for a job are set above the market-clearing level, causing the number of job-seekers to exceed the number of vacancies. On the other hand, most economists argue that as wages fall below a livable wage, many choose to drop out of the labour market and no longer seek employment. That is especially true in countries in which low-income families are supported through public welfare systems. In such cases, wages would have to be high enough to motivate people to choose employment over what they receive through public welfare. Wages below a livable wage are likely to result in lower labor market participation in the above-stated scenario. In addition, consumption of goods and services is the primary driver of increased demand for labor . Higher wages lead to workers having more income available to consume goods and services.

Many economists [ who? ] have argued that unemployment increases with increased governmental regulation. For example, minimum wage laws raise the cost of some low-skill laborers above market equilibrium, resulting in increased unemployment as people who wish to work at the going rate cannot (as the new and higher enforced wage is now greater than the value of their labour). [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Laws restricting layoffs may make businesses less likely to hire in the first place, as hiring becomes more risky. [ 9 ] However, that argument overly simplifies the relationship between wage rates and unemployment by ignoring numerous factors that contribute to unemployment. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] Some, such as Murray Rothbard , suggest that even social taboos can prevent wages from falling to the market-clearing level. [ 15 ] In Out of Work: Unemployment and Government in the Twentieth-Century America , economists Richard Vedder and Lowell Gallaway argue that the empirical record of wages rates, productivity, and unemployment in America validates classical unemployment theory.

[ 17 ] Its name is derived from the frequent ups and downs in the business cycle , but unemployment can also be persistent, such as during the Great Depression . With cyclical unemployment, the number of unemployed workers exceeds the number of job vacancies and so even if all open jobs were filled, some workers would still remain unemployed. Some associate cyclical unemployment with frictional unemployment because the factors that cause the friction are partially caused by cyclical variables. For example, a surprise decrease in the money supply may suddenly inhibit aggregate demand and thus inhibit labor demand . Keynesian economists, on the other hand, see the lack of supply of jobs as potentially resolvable by government intervention. One suggested intervention involves deficit spending to boost employment and goods demand. Another intervention involves an expansionary monetary policy to increase the supply of money , which should reduce interest rates , which, in turn, should lead to an increase in non-governmental spending. [ 18 ] In demands based theory, it is possible to abolish cyclical unemployment by increasing the aggregate demand for products and workers. However, the economy eventually hits an \" inflation barrier\" that is imposed by the four other kinds of unemployment to the extent that they exist.

[ 19 ] In the long term, the velocity of money supply measures such as the MZM (\"money zero maturity\", representing cash and equivalent demand deposits ) velocity is far more predictive of inflation than low unemployment. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] Some demand theory economists see the inflation barrier as corresponding to the natural rate of unemployment . The \"natural\" rate of unemployment is defined as the rate of unemployment that exists when the labour market is in equilibrium, and there is pressure for neither rising inflation rates nor falling inflation rates. An alternative technical term for that rate is the NAIRU , the Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment . Whatever its name, demand theory holds that if the unemployment rate gets \"too low\", inflation will accelerate in the absence of wage and price controls (incomes policies). One of the major problems with the NAIRU theory is that no one knows exactly what the NAIRU is, and it clearly changes over time. [ 19 ] The margin of error can be quite high relative to the actual unemployment rate, making it hard to use the NAIRU in policy-making. [ 20 ] Another, normative, definition of full employment might be called the ideal unemployment rate. It would exclude all types of unemployment that represent forms of inefficiency.

However, it would be impossible to attain this full-employment target using only demand-side Keynesian stimulus without getting below the NAIRU and causing accelerating inflation (absent incomes policies). Training programs aimed at fighting structural unemployment would help here. To the extent that hidden unemployment exists, it implies that official unemployment statistics provide a poor guide to what unemployment rate coincides with \"full employment\". [ 19 ] Structural unemployment occurs when a labour market is unable to provide jobs for everyone who wants one because there is a mismatch between the skills of the unemployed workers and the skills needed for the available jobs. Structural unemployment is hard to separate empirically from frictional unemployment except that it lasts longer. As with frictional unemployment, simple demand-side stimulus will not work to abolish this type of unemployment easily. Structural unemployment may also be encouraged to rise by persistent cyclical unemployment: if an economy suffers from longlasting low aggregate demand, it means that many of the unemployed become disheartened, and their skills (including job-searching skills) become \"rusty\" and obsolete. Problems with debt may lead to homelessness and a fall into the vicious cycle of poverty, which means that people affected in this way may not fit the job vacancies that are created when the economy recovers.

Alternatively, technological unemployment might refer to the way in which steady increases in labour productivity mean that fewer workers are needed to produce the same level of output every year. The fact that aggregate demand can be raised to deal with the problem suggests that the problem is instead one of cyclical unemployment. As indicated by Okun's law , the demand side must grow sufficiently quickly to absorb not only the growing labour force but also the workers who are made redundant by the increased labour productivity. Seasonal unemployment may be seen as a kind of structural unemployment since it is linked to certain kinds of jobs (construction and migratory farm work). The most-cited official unemployment measures erase this kind of unemployment from the statistics using \"seasonal adjustment\" techniques. That results in substantial and permanent structural unemployment. Frictional unemployment is the time period between jobs in which a worker searches for or transitions from one job to another. It is sometimes called search unemployment and can be voluntary, based on the circumstances of the unemployed individual. Frictional unemployment exists because both jobs and workers are heterogeneous , and a mismatch can result between the characteristics of supply and demand. Such a mismatch can be related to skills, payment, work-time, location, seasonal industries, attitude, taste, and a multitude of other factors.

Workers and employers accept a certain level of imperfection, risk or compromise, but usually not right away. They will invest some time and effort to find a better match. That is, in fact, beneficial to the economy since it results in a better allocation of resources. However, if the search takes too long and mismatches are too frequent, the economy suffers since some work will not get done. Therefore, governments will seek ways to reduce unnecessary frictional unemployment by multiple means including providing education, advice, training, and assistance such as daycare centers . The frictions in the labour market are sometimes illustrated graphically with a Beveridge curve , a downward-sloping, convex curve that shows a correlation between the unemployment rate on one axis and the vacancy rate on the other. Changes in the supply of or demand for labour cause movements along the curve. An increase or decrease in labour market frictions will shift the curve outwards or inwards. Official statistics often underestimate unemployment rates because of hidden, or covered, unemployment. [ 23 ] That is the unemployment of potential workers that are not reflected in official unemployment statistics because of how the statistics are collected.

Traditional unemployed native societies who survive by gathering, hunting, herding, and farming in wilderness areas may or may not be counted in unemployment statistics. Long-term unemployment (LTU) is defined in European Union statistics as unemployment lasting for longer than one year (while unemployment lasting over two years is defined as very long-term unemployment ). The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which reports current long-term unemployment rate at 1.9 percent, defines this as unemployment lasting 27 weeks or longer.

According to Karl Marx , unemployment is inherent within the unstable capitalist system and periodic crises of mass unemployment are to be expected. He theorized that unemployment was inevitable and even a necessary part of the capitalist system, with recovery and regrowth also part of the process. [ 28 ] The function of the proletariat within the capitalist system is to provide a \" reserve army of labour \" that creates downward pressure on wages. This is accomplished by dividing the proletariat into surplus labour (employees) and under-employment (unemployed). [ 29 ] This reserve army of labour fight among themselves for scarce jobs at lower and lower wages. At first glance, unemployment seems inefficient since unemployed workers do not increase profits, but unemployment is profitable within the global capitalist system because unemployment lowers wages which are costs from the perspective of the owners. From this perspective low wages benefit the system by reducing economic rents . Yet, it does not benefit workers; according to Karl Marx, the workers (proletariat) work to benefit the bourgeoisie through their production of capital.

As a result of the capitalist mode of production, Marx argued that workers experienced alienation and estrangement through their economic identity. [ 31 ] According to Marx, the only way to permanently eliminate unemployment would be to abolish capitalism and the system of forced competition for wages and then shift to a socialist or communist economic system. For contemporary Marxists, the existence of persistent unemployment is proof of the inability of capitalism to ensure full employment. [ 32 ] The labor force participation rate is the ratio between the labor force and the overall size of their cohort (national population of the same age range). In the West, during the latter half of the 20th century, the labor force participation rate increased significantly because of an increase in the number of women entering the workplace. In the United States, there have been four significant stages of women's participation in the labour force: increases in the 20th century and decreases in the 21st century. Male labor force participation decreased from 1953 to 2013. Since October 2013, men have been increasingly joining the labour force.

Monetary policy has evolved over the centuries, along with the development of a money economy. Historians, economists, anthropologists and numismatics do not agree on the origins of money. In the West the common point of view is that coins were first used in ancient Lydia in the 8th century BCE, whereas some date the origins to ancient China . The earliest predecessors to monetary policy seem to be those of debasement , where the government would melt coins down and mix them with cheaper metals. The practice was widespread in the late Roman Empire , but reached its perfection in western Europe in the late Middle Ages .

Interest rates , while now thought of as part of monetary authority , were not generally coordinated with the other forms of monetary policy during this time. Monetary policy was considered as an executive decision, and was generally implemented by the authority with seigniorage (the power to coin). With the advent of larger trading networks came the ability to define the currency value in terms of gold or silver, and the price of the local currency in terms of foreign currencies. This official price could be enforced by law, even if it varied from the market price. Paper money originated from promissory notes termed \" jiaozi \" in 7th-century China . Jiaozi did not replace metallic currency, and were used alongside the copper coins. The succeeding Yuan dynasty was the first government to use paper currency as the predominant circulating medium. In the later course of the dynasty, facing massive shortages of specie to fund war and maintain their rule, they began printing paper money without restrictions, resulting in hyperinflation . With the creation of the Bank of England in 1694, [ 7 ] which was granted the authority to print notes backed by gold, the idea of monetary policy as independent of executive action [ how? ] began to be established. [ 8 ] The purpose of monetary policy was to maintain the value of the coinage, print notes which would trade at par to specie, and prevent coins from leaving circulation. During the period 1870–1920, the industrialized nations established central banking systems, with one of the last being the Federal Reserve in 1913. [ 9 ] By this time the role of the central"

[ 9 ] By this time the role of the central bank as the \" lender of last resort \" was established. It was also increasingly understood that interest rates had an effect on the entire economy, in no small part because of appreciation for the marginal revolution in economics, which demonstrated that people would change their decisions based on changes in their opportunity costs . The establishment of national banks by industrializing nations was associated then with the desire to maintain the currency's relationship to the gold standard , and to trade in a narrow currency band with other gold-backed currencies. To accomplish this end, central banks as part of the gold standard began setting the interest rates that they charged both their own borrowers and other banks which required money for liquidity. The maintenance of a gold standard required almost monthly adjustments of interest rates. The gold standard is a system by which the price of the national currency is fixed vis-a-vis the value of gold, and is kept constant by the government's promise to buy or sell gold at a fixed price in terms of the base currency. The gold standard might be regarded as a special case of \"fixed exchange rate\" policy, or as a special type of commodity price level targeting. However, the policies required to maintain the gold standard might be harmful to employment and general economic activity and probably exacerbated the Great Depression in the 1930s in many countries, leading eventually to the demise of the gold standards and efforts to create a more"

[ 10 ] Nowadays the gold standard is no longer used by any country. [ 11 ] In 1944, the Bretton Woods system was established, which created the International Monetary Fund and introduced a fixed exchange rate system linking the currencies of most industrialized nations to the US dollar, which as the only currency in the system would be directly convertible to gold. [ 12 ] During the following decades the system secured stable exchange rates internationally, but the system broke down during the 1970s when the dollar increasingly came to be viewed as overvalued. In 1971, the dollar's convertibility into gold was suspended. Attempts to revive the fixed exchange rates failed, and by 1973 the major currencies began to float against each other. [ 13 ] In Europe, various attempts were made to establish a regional fixed exchange rate system via the European Monetary System , leading eventually to the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union and the introduction of the currency euro . Monetarist economists long contended that the money-supply growth could affect the macroeconomy. These included Milton Friedman who early in his career advocated that government budget deficits during recessions be financed in equal amount by money creation to help to stimulate aggregate demand for production.

[ 15 ] During the 1970s inflation rose in many countries caused by the 1970s energy crisis , and several central banks turned to a money supply target in an attempt to reduce inflation. However, when U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker tried this policy, starting in October 1979, it was found to be impractical, because of the unstable relationship between monetary aggregates and other macroeconomic variables, and similar results prevailed in other countries. [ 10 ] [ 16 ] Even Milton Friedman later acknowledged that direct money supplying was less successful than he had hoped. [ 17 ] In 1990, New Zealand as the first country ever adopted an official inflation target as the basis of its monetary policy. The idea is that the central bank tries to adjust interest rates in order to steer the country's inflation rate towards the official target instead of following indirect objectives like exchange rate stability or money supply growth, the purpose of which is normally also ultimately to obtain low and stable inflation. The strategy was generally considered to work well, and central banks in most developed countries have over the years adapted a similar strategy. [ 18 ] The 2008 financial crisis sparked controversy over the use and flexibility of the inflation targeting employed.

[ 19 ] As of 2023, the central banks of all G7 member countries can be said to follow an inflation target, including the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve , who have adopted the main elements of inflation targeting without officially calling themselves inflation targeters. [ 18 ] In emerging countries fixed exchange rate regimes are still the most common monetary policy. [ 20 ] According to Zhang's dataset, 45 individual countries and the Eurozone have adopted inflation targeting as of 2024. Central banks have set an average inflation target of 3.5 percent, though specific targets range widely from 2 to 35 percent. Average lower and upper bounds of the inflation target bands are 2.3 percent and 4.7 percent. Central banks have maintained inflation within their target ranges for 44 percent of the time in any given year. [ 21 ] The instruments available to central banks for conducting monetary policy vary from country to country, depending on the country's stage of development, institutional structure and political system. [ 1 ] The main monetary policy instruments available to central banks are interest rate policy , i.e. setting (administered) interest rates directly, open market operations , forward guidance and other communication activities, bank reserve requirements , and re-lending and re-discount (including using the term repurchase market).

Expansionary policy occurs when a monetary authority uses its instruments to stimulate the economy. An expansionary policy decreases short-term interest rates, affecting broader financial conditions to encourage spending on goods and services, in turn leading to increased employment. By affecting the exchange rate , it may also stimulate net export . [ 22 ] Contractionary policy works in the opposite direction: Increasing interest rates will depress borrowing and spending by consumers and businesses, dampening inflationary pressure in the economy together with employment. [ 22 ] For most central banks in advanced economies, their main monetary policy instrument is a short-term interest rate. [ 23 ] For monetary policy frameworks operating under an exchange rate anchor, adjusting interest rates are, together with direct intervention in the foreign exchange market (i.e. open market operations), important tools to maintain the desired exchange rate. [ 24 ] For central banks targeting inflation directly, adjusting interest rates are crucial for the monetary transmission mechanism which ultimately affects inflation. Changes in the central bank policy rates normally affect the interest rates that banks and other lenders charge on loans to firms and households. Higher interest rates reduce inflation by reducing aggregate consumption of goods and services by several causal paths.

Interest rate changes also affect asset prices like stock prices and house prices . Though unless they are selling or taking out new loans their cash flow is unaffected, asset owners feel less wealthy (the wealth effect ) and reduce spending. Rising interest rates also have smaller secondary effects, which decrease supply and tend to increase inflation (or cause it to decrease more slowly than it otherwise would. On the individual side, rising mortgage rates disincentivize wealthy homeowners from downsizing or moving to a new home if they have an existing mortgage that is locked in at a low fixed rate. [ 26 ] On the business side, lower investment and spending may result in lower supply of new homes and other goods and services. Firms experiencing high borrowing costs are also less willing or able to borrow or spend money on investment in new or expanding business. International interest rate differentials also affect exchange rates, and consequently exports and imports . Consumption, investment, and net exports are all important components of aggregate demand.

[ 23 ] By setting administered rates that commercial banks and possibly other financial institutions will receive for their deposits in the central bank, respectively pay for loans from the central bank, the central monetary authority can create a band (or \"corridor\") within which market interbank short-term interest rates will typically move. Depending on the specific details, the resulting specific market interest rate may either be created by open market operations by the central bank (a so-called \"corridor system\") or in practice equal the administered rate (a \"floor system\", practiced by the Federal Reserve [ 29 ] among others). [ 23 ] [ 30 ] As an example of how this functions, the Bank of Canada sets a target overnight rate , and a band of plus or minus 0.25%. Qualified banks borrow from each other within this band, but never above or below, because the central bank will always lend to them at the top of the band, and take deposits at the bottom of the band; in principle, the capacity to borrow and lend at the extremes of the band are unlimited. [ 31 ] The target rates are generally short-term rates. The actual rate that borrowers and lenders receive on the market will depend on (perceived) credit risk, maturity and other factors.

Many central banks have one primary \"headline\" rate that is quoted as the \"central bank rate\". In practice, they will have other tools and rates that are used, but only one that is rigorously targeted and enforced. A typical central bank consequently has several interest rates or monetary policy tools it can use to influence markets. Through open market operations , a central bank may influence the level of interest rates, the exchange rate and/or the money supply in an economy. Open market operations can influence interest rates by expanding or contracting the monetary base , which consists of currency in circulation and banks' reserves on deposit at the central bank. Each time a central bank buys securities (such as a government bond or treasury bill), it in effect creates money . The central bank exchanges money for the security, increasing the monetary base while lowering the supply of the specific security. Conversely, selling of securities by the central bank reduces the monetary base. Open market operations usually take the form of: Forward guidance is a communication practice whereby the central bank announces its forecasts and future intentions to influence market expectations of future levels of interest rates .

Banks would hold only a small percentage of their assets in the form of cash reserves as insurance against bank runs. Over time this process has been regulated and insured by central banks. Such legal reserve requirements were introduced in the 19th century as an attempt to reduce the risk of banks overextending themselves and suffering from bank runs , as this could lead to knock-on effects on other overextended banks. A number of central banks have since abolished their reserve requirements over the last few decades, beginning with the Reserve Bank of New Zealand in 1985 and continuing with the Federal Reserve in 2020. For the respective banking systems, bank capital requirements provide a check on the growth of the money supply. The People's Bank of China retains (and uses) more powers over reserves because the yuan that it manages is a non- convertible currency .

The central bank money after aggregate settlement – \"final money\" – can take only one of two forms: The currency component of the money supply is far smaller than the deposit component.

    "text": "Heterodox In economics and political science , fiscal policy is the use of government revenue collection ( taxes or tax cuts ) and expenditure to influence a country's economy. The use of government revenue expenditures to influence macroeconomic variables developed in reaction to the Great Depression of the 1930s, when the previous laissez-faire approach to economic management became unworkable. Fiscal policy is based on the theories of the British economist John Maynard Keynes , whose Keynesian economics theorised that government changes in the levels of taxation and government spending influence aggregate demand and the level of economic activity. Fiscal and monetary policy are the key strategies used by a country's government and central bank to advance its economic objectives. The combination of these policies enables these authorities to target inflation and to increase employment. In modern economies, inflation is conventionally considered \"healthy\" in the range of 2%–3%. Additionally, it is designed to try to keep GDP growth at 2%–3% and the unemployment rate near the natural unemployment rate of 4%–5%. [ 1 ] This implies that fiscal policy is used to stabilise the economy over the course of the business cycle . [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Changes in the level and composition of taxation and government spending can affect macroeconomic variables, including: Fiscal policy can be distinguished from monetary policy , in that fiscal policy deals with taxation and government spending and is often administered by a government department; while monetary policy deals with the money supply , interest rates and is often administered by a country's central bank . Both fiscal and monetary policies influence a country's economic performance.

Additionally, fiscal policy can potentially have more supply-side effects on the economy: to reduce inflation, the measures of increasing taxes and lowering spending would not be preferred, so the government might be reluctant to use these. Monetary policy is generally quicker to implement as interest rates can be set every month, while the decision to increase government spending might take time to figure out which area the money should be spent on. [ 5 ] The recession of the 2000s decade shows that monetary policy also has certain limitations. A liquidity trap occurs when interest rate cuts are insufficient as a demand booster as banks do not want to lend and the consumers are reluctant to increase spending due to negative expectations for the economy. Government spending is responsible for creating the demand in the economy and can provide a kick-start to get the economy out of the recession. When a deep recession takes place, it is not sufficient to rely just on monetary policy to restore the economic equilibrium.

[ 6 ] In 2000, a survey of 298 members of the American Economic Association (AEA) found that while 84 percent generally agreed with the statement \"Fiscal policy has a significant stimulative impact on a less than fully employed economy\", 71 percent also generally agreed with the statement \" Management of the business cycle should be left to the Federal Reserve ; activist fiscal policy should be avoided.\" [ 7 ] In 2011, a follow-up survey of 568 AEA members found that the previous consensus about the latter proposition had dissolved and was by then roughly evenly disputed.

The three stances of fiscal policy are the following: [ 9 ] However, these definitions can be misleading because, even with no changes in spending or tax laws at all, cyclic fluctuations of the economy cause cyclic fluctuations of tax revenues and of some types of government spending, altering the deficit situation; these are not considered to be policy changes.

Governments spend money on a wide variety of things, from the military and police to services such as education and health care, as well as transfer payments such as welfare benefits. This expenditure can be funded in a number of different ways: A fiscal deficit is often funded by issuing bonds such as Treasury bills or and gilt-edged securities but can also be funded by issuing equity. Bonds pay interest, either for a fixed period or indefinitely that is funded by taxpayers as a whole. Equity offers returns on investment (interest) that can only be realized in discharging a future tax liability by an individual taxpayer. If available government revenue is insufficient to support the interest payments on bonds, a nation may default on its debts, usually to foreign creditors. Public debt or borrowing refers to the government borrowing from the public. It is impossible for a government to \"default\" on its equity since the total returns available to all investors (taxpayers) are limited at any point by the total current year tax liability of all investors.

The concept of a balanced budget amendment or fiscal straitjacket is a general economic principle that suggests strict constraints on government spending and public sector borrowing, to limit or regulate the budget deficit over a time period. Most US states have balanced budget rules that prevent them from running a deficit. The United States federal government technically has a legal cap on the total amount of money it can borrow , but it is not a meaningful constraint because the cap can be raised as easily as spending can be authorized, and the cap is almost always raised before the debt gets that high. A balanced budget amendment can include an adjustment for business cycles . [ 12 ] The impact of fiscal policy is primarily talked about in the context of developed economies. However, fiscal policy is utilized differently in developing countries . Instead of maintaining economic growth , it is used to generate additional economic growth through improving human capital . This can be done by investment in public expenditures such as infrastructure and education. When done successfully, it can result in long-term economic gains. [ 13 ] Nevertheless, developing countries must still consider the impact fiscal policy will have on inflation and unemployment.

The tax revenue collected by developed countries is almost twice that of developing countries in terms of percentage of GDP. [ 15 ] In addition, there is a growing debt crisis in developing countries that has reached $11.4 trillion, fueled partly by development projects. [ 16 ] This has led to governments prioritizing repaying debt over funding public essential services. [ 16 ] Many developing countries have been left unable to continue implementing appropriate fiscal policy due to a lack of resources. Governments use fiscal policy to influence the level of aggregate demand in the economy, so that certain economic goals can be achieved: [ 17 ] The Keynesian view of economics suggests that increasing government spending and decreasing the rate of taxes are the best ways to have an influence on aggregate demand , stimulate it, while decreasing spending and increasing taxes after the economic expansion has already taken place. Additionally, Keynesians argue that expansionary fiscal policy should be used in times of recession or low economic activity as an essential tool for building the framework for strong economic growth and working towards full employment . In theory, the resulting deficits would be paid for by an expanded economy during the expansion that would follow; this was the reasoning behind the New Deal .

As the government increases spending, there will be a shift in the IS curve up and to the right. In the short run , this increases the real interest rate , which then reduces private investment and increases aggregate demand, placing upward pressure on supply. To meet the short-run increase in aggregate demand, firms increase full-employment output. The increase in short-run price levels reduces the money supply , which shifts the LM curve back, and thus, returning the general equilibrium to the original full employment (FE) level. Therefore, the IS-LM model shows that there will be an overall increase in the price level and real interest rates in the long run due to fiscal expansion. [ 19 ] Governments can use a budget surplus to do two things: Keynesian theory posits that removing spending from the economy will reduce levels of aggregate demand and contract the economy, thus stabilizing prices. Another model commonly used to understand the impacts of fiscal policy is the Aggregate Demand - Aggregate Supply ( AD-AS) model . It is similar to the IS-LM model but allows for the price level to vary, making it the superior model for a long-run analysis. [ 20 ] Economists still debate the effectiveness of fiscal stimulus . The argument mostly centers on crowding out : whether government borrowing leads to higher interest rates that may offset the stimulative impact of spending. When the government runs a budget deficit, funds will need to come from public borrowing (the issue of government bonds), overseas borrowing, or monetizing the debt.

When the government runs a budget deficit, funds will need to come from public borrowing (the issue of government bonds), overseas borrowing, or monetizing the debt. When governments fund a deficit with the issuing of government bonds, interest rates can increase across the market, because government borrowing creates higher demand for credit in the financial markets. This decreases aggregate demand for goods and services, either partially or entirely offsetting the direct expansionary impact of the deficit spending, thus diminishing or eliminating the achievement of the objective of a fiscal stimulus. Neoclassical economists generally emphasize crowding out while Keynesians argue that fiscal policy can still be effective, especially in a liquidity trap where, they argue, crowding out is minimal. [ 21 ] In the classical view, expansionary fiscal policy also decreases net exports, which has a mitigating effect on national output and income. When government borrowing increases interest rates it attracts foreign capital from foreign investors. This is because, all other things being equal, the bonds issued from a country executing expansionary fiscal policy now offer a higher rate of return. In other words, companies wanting to finance projects must compete with their government for capital so they offer higher rates of return. To purchase bonds originating from a certain country, foreign investors must obtain that country's currency. Therefore, when foreign capital flows into the country undergoing fiscal expansion, demand for that country's currency increases. The increased demand, in turn, causes the currency to appreciate, reducing the cost of imports and making exports from that country more expensive to foreigners. Consequently, exports decrease and imports increase, reducing demand from net exports . [ 22 ] Some economists oppose the discretionary use of fiscal stimulus because of the"

[ 22 ] Some economists oppose the discretionary use of fiscal stimulus because of the inside lag (the time lag involved in implementing it), which is almost inevitably long because of the substantial legislative effort involved. Further, the outside lag between the time of implementation and the time that most of the effects of the stimulus are felt could mean that the stimulus hits an already-recovering economy and overheats the ensuing h rather than stimulating the economy when it needs it. [ 23 ] Some economists are also concerned about potential inflationary effects driven by increased demand engendered by a fiscal stimulus. In theory, fiscal stimulus does not cause inflation when it uses resources that would have otherwise been idle. For instance, if a fiscal stimulus employs a worker who otherwise would have been unemployed , there is no inflationary effect; however, if the stimulus employs a worker who otherwise would have had a job, the stimulus is increasing labor demand while labor supply remains fixed, leading to wage inflation and therefore price inflation .

While international trade has existed throughout history (for example Uttarapatha , Silk Road , Amber Road , salt roads ), its economic, social, and political importance has been on the rise in recent centuries. Carrying out trade at an international level is a complex process when compared to domestic trade . When trade takes place between two or more states , factors like currency , government policies, economy, judicial system , laws, and markets influence trade. To ease and justify the process of trade between countries of different economic standing in the modern era, some international economic organizations were formed, such as the World Trade Organization . These organizations work towards the facilitation and growth of international trade. Statistical services of intergovernmental and supranational organizations and governmental statistical agencies publish official statistics on international trade. A product that is transferred or sold from a party in one country to a party in another country is an export from the originating country, and an import to the country receiving that product. Imports and exports are accounted for in a country's current account in the balance of payments .

Advanced technology (including transportation ), globalization , industrialization , outsourcing and multinational corporations have major impacts on the international trade systems . International trade is, in principle, not different from domestic trade as the motivation and the behavior of parties involved in a trade do not change fundamentally regardless of whether trade is across a border or not. However, in practical terms, carrying out trade at an international level is typically a more complex process than domestic trade. The main difference is that international trade is typically more costly than domestic trade. This is due to the fact that cross-border trade typically incurs additional costs such as explicit tariffs as well as explicit or implicit non-tariff barriers such as time costs (due to border delays), language and cultural differences, product safety, the legal system, and so on. Another difference between domestic and international trade is that factors of production such as capital and labor are often more mobile within a country than across countries. Thus, international trade is mostly restricted to trade in goods and services, and only to a lesser extent to trade in capital, labour, or other factors of production. Trade in goods and services can serve as a substitute for trade in factors of production. Instead of importing a factor of production, a country can import goods that make intensive use of that factor of production and thus embody it. An example of this is the import of labor-intensive goods by the United States from China . Instead of importing"

Higher wages incentivize automation [ 23 ] which could allow for automated workers' time to be reallocated by society and its economic mechanisms or be converted into leisure-like time.

Regional differences may cause specific regions to be more suitable for a specific production, thereby increasing the advantages of specific trade over specific local production.

It can be attributed to a series of factors, including the reduction of barriers to international trade , the liberalization of capital movements, the development of transportation infrastructure, and the advancement of information and communication technologies . [ 1 ] The term globalization first appeared in the early 20th century (supplanting an earlier French term mondialisation ). It developed its current meaning sometime in the second half of the 20th century, and came into popular use in the 1990s to describe the unprecedented international connectivity of the post–Cold War world .

These developments increased global interactions, fostering the growth of international trade and the exchange of ideas, beliefs, and cultures. While globalization is primarily an economic process of interaction and integration, it is also closely linked to social and cultural dynamics. Additionally, disputes and international diplomacy have played significant roles in the history and evolution of globalization, continuing to shape its modern form. Though many scholars place the origins of globalization in modern times , others trace its history to long before the European Age of Discovery and voyages to the New World , and some even to the third millennium BCE.

Countries have built economic partnerships to facilitate these movements over many centuries. Economically, globalization involves goods, services , data, technology, and the economic resources of capital .

Removal of cross-border trade barriers has made the formation of global markets more feasible.

He calls the transmission of ideas, images, knowledge, and information across world-space disembodied globalization, maintaining that it is currently the dominant form of globalization.

He asserted that the pace of globalization was quickening and that its impact on business organization and practice would continue to grow. [ 31 ] Economist Takis Fotopoulos defined \"economic globalization\" as the opening and deregulation of commodity , capital , and labor markets that led toward the present neoliberal globalization. He used \"political globalization\" to refer to the emergence of a transnational élite and a phasing out of the nation-state . Meanwhile, he used \"cultural globalization\" to reference the worldwide homogenization of culture.

Because it predated the Great Divergence in the nineteenth century, where Western Europe pulled ahead of the rest of the world in terms of industrial production and economic output , archaic globalization was a phenomenon that was driven not only by Europe but also by other economically developed Old World centers such as Gujarat , Bengal , coastal China , and Japan . [ 39 ] The German historical economist and sociologist Andre Gunder Frank argues that a form of globalization began with the rise of trade links between Sumer and the Indus Valley civilization in the third millennium BCE . This archaic globalization continued during the Hellenistic Age , when commercialized urban centers enveloped the axis of Greek culture that reached from India to Spain, including Alexandria and the other Alexandrine cities. Early on, the geographic position of Greece, Greek demographics and the necessity of importing wheat encouraged Greek city-states to found outpost colonies [ 40 ] and to engage in maritime trade.

[ 43 ] Though silk was certainly the major trade-item from China, common goods such as salt and sugar were traded as well; and religions , syncretic philosophies, and various technologies, as well as diseases, also traveled along the Silk Routes . In addition to economic trade, the Silk Road served as a means of carrying out cultural trade among the civilizations along its network.

In the 17th century, world trade developed further when chartered companies like the British East India Company (founded in 1600) and the Dutch East India Company (founded in 1602, often described as the first multinational corporation in which stock was offered) were established.

[ 50 ] [ 51 ] Early modern globalization is distinguished from modern globalization on the basis of expansionism , the method of managing global trade, and the level of information exchange. The period is marked by the shift of hegemony to Western Europe, the rise of larger-scale conflicts between powerful nations such as the Thirty Years' War , and demand for commodities, most particularly slaves . The triangular trade made it possible for Europe to take advantage of resources within the Western Hemisphere . The transfer of animal stocks, plant crops, and epidemic diseases associated with Alfred W. Crosby 's concept of the Columbian exchange also played a central role in this process.

According to economic historians Kevin O'Rourke , Leandro Prados de la Escosura and Guillaume Daudin , several factors promoted globalization in the period 1815–1870: [ 52 ] During the 19th century, globalization approached its form as a direct result of the Industrial Revolution . Industrialization allowed standardized production of household items using economies of scale while rapid population growth created sustained demand for commodities. In the 19th century, steamships reduced the cost of international transportation significantly and railroads made inland transportation cheaper. The transportation revolution occurred some time between 1820 and 1850. [ 37 ] More nations embraced international trade . [ 37 ] Globalization in this period was decisively shaped by nineteenth-century imperialism such as in Africa and Asia . [ 53 ] [ 54 ] After World War II, work by politicians led to the agreements of the Bretton Woods Conference , in which major governments laid down the framework for international monetary policy , commerce, and finance, and the founding of several international institutions intended to facilitate economic growth by lowering trade barriers . Initially, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) led to a series of agreements to remove trade restrictions. GATT's successor was the World Trade Organization (WTO), which provided a framework for negotiating and formalizing trade agreements and a dispute resolution process.

[ 11 ] Economists instead conceptualized humans as purely rational and self-interested decision makers, illustrated in the concept of homo economicus . [ 14 ] A key precursor was the notion of bounded rationality, which relaxed the assumption of fully optimal decision-making under cognitive and informational constraints. [ 16 ] A pivotal early challenge to the dominance of expected-utility theory was mounted by French economist Maurice Allais . In his seminal 1953 paper, Allais presented empirical examples now known as the Allais paradox — notably the “common-ratio” and “common-consequence” effects — which demonstrated systematic deviations from expected-utility maximization. Experimental evidence summarized in recent meta-analytic work confirms that the common-ratio effect remains observable under many conditions. For instance, Blavatskyy, Panchenko & Ortmann (2023) re-examined data from 39 prior experiments (14,909 observations) and found that about 59.4% of designs reproduced the common-ratio pattern. [ 17 ] The resurgence of psychology within economics, which facilitated the expansion of behavioral economics, has been linked to the cognitive revolution . [ 18 ] [ 19 ] In the 1960s, cognitive psychology began to shed more light on the brain as an information processing device (in contrast to behaviorist models). Psychologists in this field, such as Ward Edwards, [ 20 ] Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman began to compare their cognitive models of decision-making under risk and uncertainty to economic models of rational behavior.

In challenging the accuracy of generic utility, these concepts established a practice foundational in behavioral economics: Building on standard models by applying psychological knowledge. [ 6 ] These developments helped set the stage for the field’s broader acceptance in mainstream economics in subsequent decades, alongside growing research output and incorporation into teaching. [ 21 ] Over time, behavioral insights were increasingly applied beyond individual choice to policy design, with evidence informing how economic tools and institutions affect behavior. [ 22 ] Mathematical psychology reflects a long-standing interest in preference transitivity and the measurement of utility. [ 23 ] Its consolidation as a distinct area is also reflected in scholarly classification systems, which list behavioral economics as a dedicated subject category. [ 24 ] In 2017, Niels Geiger, a lecturer in economics at the University of Hohenheim conducted an investigation into the proliferation of behavioral economics. [ 8 ] Geiger's research looked at studies that had quantified the frequency of references to terms specific to behavioral economics, and how often influential papers in behavioral economics were cited in journals on economics.

[ 8 ] Bounded rationality is the idea that when individuals make decisions, their rationality is limited by the tractability of the decision problem, their cognitive limitations and the time available. Herbert A. Simon proposed bounded rationality as an alternative basis for the mathematical modeling of decision-making . It complements \"rationality as optimization\", which views decision-making as a fully rational process of finding an optimal choice given the information available. [ 25 ] Simon used the analogy of a pair of scissors, where one blade represents human cognitive limitations and the other the \"structures of the environment\", illustrating how minds compensate for limited resources by exploiting known structural regularity in the environment. [ 25 ] Bounded rationality implicates the idea that humans take shortcuts that may lead to suboptimal decision-making. Behavioral economists engage in mapping the decision shortcuts that agents use in order to help increase the effectiveness of human decision-making. Bounded rationality finds that actors do not assess all available options appropriately, in order to save on search and deliberation costs. As such decisions are not always made in the sense of greatest self-reward as limited information is available. Instead agents shall choose to settle for an acceptable solution. One approach, adopted by Richard M. Cyert and James G. March in their 1963 book A Behavioral Theory of the Firm , was to view firms as coalitions of groups whose targets were based on satisficing rather than optimizing behaviour.

A widely cited proposal from Sunstein and Thaler urges that healthier food be placed at sight level in order to increase the likelihood that a person will opt for that choice instead of less healthy option. Some critics of Nudge have lodged attacks that modifying choice architectures will lead to people becoming worse decision-makers. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] In 1979, Kahneman and Tversky published Prospect Theory : An Analysis of Decision Under Risk , that used cognitive psychology to explain various divergences of economic decision making from neo-classical theory. [ 32 ] Kahneman and Tversky utilising prospect theory determined three generalisations; gains are treated differently than losses, outcomes received with certainty are overweighed relative to uncertain outcomes and the structure of the problem may affect choices. These arguments were supported in part by altering a survey question so that it was no longer a case of achieving gains but averting losses and the majority of respondents altered their answers accordingly. In essence proving that emotions such as fear of loss, or greed can alter decisions, indicating the presence of an irrational decision-making process. Prospect theory has two stages: an editing stage and an evaluation stage. In the editing stage, risky situations are simplified using various heuristics . In the evaluation phase, risky alternatives are evaluated using various psychological principles that include: In 1992, in the Journal of Risk and Uncertainty , Kahneman and Tversky gave a revised account of prospect theory that they called cumulative prospect theory .

Its main feature was that it allowed for non-linear probability weighting in a cumulative manner, which was originally suggested in John Quiggin 's rank-dependent utility theory. Psychological traits such as overconfidence , projection bias and the effects of limited attention are now part of the theory. Other developments include a conference at the University of Chicago , [ 34 ] a special behavioral economics edition of the Quarterly Journal of Economics (\"In Memory of Amos Tversky\"), and Kahneman's 2002 Nobel Prize for having \"integrated insights from psychological research into economic science, especially concerning human judgment and decision-making under uncertainty.\" [ 35 ] A further argument of Behavioural Economics relates to the impact of the individual's cognitive limitations as a factor in limiting the rationality of people's decisions. Sloan first argued this in his paper 'Bounded Rationality' where he stated that our cognitive limitations are somewhat the consequence of our limited ability to foresee the future, hampering the rationality of decision. [ 36 ] Daniel Kahneman further expanded upon the effect cognitive ability and processes have on decision making in his book Thinking, Fast and Slow . He delved into two forms of thought: fast thinking, which he considered \"operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control\", [ 37 ] and slow thinking, the allocation of cognitive ability, choice, and concentration.

He proposed that hindsight bias, confirmation bias, and outcome bias (among others) originate from such shortcuts. A key example of fast thinking and the resultant irrational decisions is the 2008 financial crisis. Nudge is a concept in behavioral science , political theory and economics which proposes designs or changes in decision environments as ways to influence the behavior and decision making of groups or individuals—in other words, it's \"a way to manipulate people's choices to lead them to make specific decisions\". [ 38 ] The first formulation of the term and associated principles was developed in cybernetics by James Wilk before 1995 and described by Brunel University academic D. J. Stewart as \"the art of the nudge\" (sometimes referred to as micronudges [ 39 ] ). It also drew on methodological influences from clinical psychotherapy tracing back to Gregory Bateson , including contributions from Milton Erickson , Watzlawick , Weakland and Fisch, and Bill O'Hanlon. [ 40 ] In this variant, the nudge is a microtargeted design geared towards a specific group of people, irrespective of the scale of intended intervention. In 2008, Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein 's book Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness brought nudge theory to prominence.

[ 42 ] Thaler and Sunstein defined their concept as: [ 43 ] A nudge, as we will use the term, is any aspect of the choice architecture that alters people's behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives. To count as a mere nudge, the intervention must be easy and cheap to avoid. Nudges are not mandates. Putting fruit at eye level counts as a nudge. Banning junk food does not. Nudging techniques aim to capitalise on the judgemental heuristics of people. In other words, a nudge alters the environment so that when heuristic, or System 1, decision-making is used, the resulting choice will be the most positive or desired outcome. [ 44 ] An example of such a nudge is switching the placement of junk food in a store, so that fruit and other healthy options are located next to the cash register, while junk food is relocated to another part of the store.

Regarding its application to HSE, one of the primary goals of nudge is to achieve a \"zero accident culture\". [ 49 ] In contrast to nudges, which aim to guide people toward better decisions, Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein also introduced the concept of sludge , which refers to unnecessary frictions or barriers that make it harder for individuals to take beneficial actions—such as confusing forms or hidden fees. [ 50 ] Cass Sunstein has responded to critiques at length in his The Ethics of Influence [ 51 ] making the case in favor of nudging against charges that nudges diminish autonomy, [ 52 ] threaten dignity, violate liberties, or reduce welfare.

The study questions whether such subliminal tactics cross ethical boundaries by manipulating impulse control in ways that blur the line between persuasion and coercion.

Behavioral economics aims to improve or overhaul traditional economic theory by studying failures in its assumptions that people are rational and selfish. Specifically, it studies the biases, tendencies and heuristics of people's economic decisions. It aids in determining whether people make good choices and whether they could be helped to make better choices. It can be applied both before and after a decision is made.

Behavioral economics proposes search heuristics as an aid for evaluating options. It is motivated by the fact that it is costly to gain information about options and it aims to maximise the utility of searching for information. While each heuristic is not wholistic in its explanation of the search process alone, a combination of these heuristics may be used in the decision-making process. There are three primary search heuristics. Satisficing Satisficing is the idea that there is some minimum requirement from the search and once that has been met, stop searching. After satisficing, a person may not have the most optimal option (i.e. the one with the highest utility), but would have a \"good enough\" one. This heuristic may be problematic if the aspiration level is set at such a level that no products exist that could meet the requirements. Directed cognition Directed cognition is a search heuristic in which a person treats each opportunity to research information as their last. Rather than a contingent plan that indicates what will be done based on the results of each search, directed cognition considers only if one more search should be conducted and what alternative should be researched. Elimination by aspects Whereas satisficing and directed cognition compare choices, elimination by aspects compares certain qualities. A person using the elimination by aspects heuristic first chooses the quality that they value most in what they are searching for and sets an aspiration level. This may be repeated to refine the search. i.e. identify the second most valued quality and set an aspiration level. Using this heuristic, options will be eliminated as they fail to meet the minimum requirements of the chosen"

[ 67 ] Besides searching, behavioral economists and psychologists have identified other heuristics and other cognitive effects that affect people's decision making. These include: Mental accounting Mental accounting refers to the propensity to allocate resources for specific purposes. Mental accounting is a behavioral bias that causes one to separate money into different categories known as mental accounts either based on the source or the intention of the money. [ 68 ] Anchoring Anchoring describes when people have a mental reference point with which they compare results to. For example, a person who anticipates that the weather on a particular day would be raining, but finds that on the day it is actually clear blue skies,"

    "text": "Cognitive psychology is the scientific study of human mental processes such as attention , language use, memory , perception , problem solving, creativity , and reasoning . [ 1 ] Cognitive psychology originated in the 1960s in a break from behaviorism , which held from the 1920s to 1950s that unobservable mental processes were outside the realm of empirical science . This break came as researchers in linguistics , cybernetics , and applied psychology used models of mental processing to explain human behavior. Work derived from cognitive psychology was integrated into other branches of psychology and various other modern disciplines like cognitive science , linguistics , and economics . [ 2 ] Philosophically, ruminations on the human mind and its processes have been around since the time of the ancient Greeks . In 387 BCE, Plato suggested that the brain was the seat of mental processes. [ 3 ] In 1637, René Descartes posited that humans have innate ideas and promulgated mind-body dualism , which came to be known as substance dualism (essentially the idea that the mind and the body are two separate substances). [ 4 ] From that time, major debates ensued through the 19th century about whether human thought is solely experiential ( empiricism ) or includes innate knowledge ( nativism ). Some of those involved in this debate include George Berkeley and John Locke on the side of empiricism, and Immanuel Kant on the side of nativism. [ 5 ] With the philosophical debate continuing, the mid- to late 19th century was a critical time in the development of psychology as a scientific discipline. Two discoveries that later played substantial roles in cognitive psychology were Paul Broca 's discovery of the area of the brain largely responsible for language production [ 4 ] and Carl Wernicke"

Two discoveries that later played substantial roles in cognitive psychology were Paul Broca 's discovery of the area of the brain largely responsible for language production [ 4 ] and Carl Wernicke 's discovery of an area thought to be mostly responsible for comprehension of language. [ 6 ] Both areas were subsequently formally named for their founders, and disruptions of an individual's language production or comprehension due to trauma or malformation in these areas have come to commonly be known as Broca's aphasia and Wernicke's aphasia . [ 2 ] From the 1920s to the 1950s, the main approach to psychology was behaviorism . Initially, its adherents viewed mental events such as thoughts, ideas, attention, and consciousness as unobservable, hence outside the realm of a science of psychology. A pioneer of cognitive psychology, whose work predated much of behaviorist literature, was Carl Jung . Jung introduced the hypothesis of cognitive functions in his 1921 book Psychological Types . [ 7 ] Another pioneer of cognitive psychology, who worked outside the boundaries (both intellectual and geographical) of behaviorism, was Jean Piaget . From 1926 to the 1950s and into the 1980s, he studied the thoughts, language, and intelligence of children and adults. [ 8 ] In the mid-20th century, four main influences arose that inspired and shaped cognitive psychology as a formal school of thought: Ulric Neisser put the term \"cognitive psychology\" into common use through his 1967 book Cognitive Psychology .

It is concerned with these processes even when they operate in the absence of relevant stimulation, as in images and hallucinations . ... Given such a sweeping definition, it is apparent that cognition is involved in everything a human being might possibly do; that every psychological phenomenon is a cognitive phenomenon. But although cognitive psychology is concerned with all human activity rather than some fraction of it, the concern is from a particular point of view. Other viewpoints are equally legitimate and necessary. Dynamic psychology , which begins with motives rather than with sensory input, is a case in point. Instead of asking how a man's actions and experiences result from what he saw, remembered, or believed, the dynamic psychologist asks how they follow from the subject's goals, needs, or instincts. [ 12 ] The main focus of cognitive psychologists is the mental processes that affect behavior. Those processes include, but are not limited to, the following three stages of memory: [ 14 ] [ original research? ] The psychological definition of attention is \"a state of focused awareness on a subset of the available sensation perception information\". [ 15 ] A key function of attention is to identify irrelevant data and filter it out, enabling significant data to be distributed to the other mental processes . [ 5 ] For example, the human brain may simultaneously receive auditory , visual , olfactory , taste , and tactile information. The brain is able to consciously handle only a small subset of this information,"

The brain is able to consciously handle only a small subset of this information, and this is accomplished through the attentional processes. [ 5 ] Attention can be divided into two major attentional systems: exogenous control and endogenous control. [ 16 ] Exogenous control works in a bottom-up manner and is responsible for orienting reflex , and pop-out effects. [ 16 ] Endogenous control works top-down and is the more deliberate attentional system, responsible for divided attention and conscious processing. [ 16 ] One major focal point relating to attention within the field of cognitive psychology is the concept of divided attention. A number of early studies dealt with the ability of a person wearing headphones to discern meaningful conversation when presented with different messages into each ear; this is known as the dichotic listening task. [ 5 ] Key findings involved an increased understanding of the mind's ability to both focus on one message, while still being somewhat aware of information being taken in from the ear not being consciously attended to. For example, participants (wearing earphones) may be told that they will be hearing separate messages in each ear and that they are expected to attend only to information related to basketball. When the experiment starts, the message about basketball will be presented to the left ear and non-relevant information will be presented to the right ear. At some point the message related to basketball will switch to the right ear and the non-relevant information to the left ear. When this happens, the listener is usually able to repeat the entire message"

When this happens, the listener is usually able to repeat the entire message at the end, having attended to the left or right ear only when it was appropriate. [ 5 ] The ability to attend to one conversation in the face of many is known as the cocktail party effect . Other major findings include that participants cannot comprehend both passages when shadowing one passage, they cannot report the content of the unattended message, while they can shadow a message better if the pitches in each ear are different. [ 17 ] However, while deep processing does not occur, early sensory processing does. Subjects did notice if the pitch of the unattended message changed or if it ceased altogether, and some even oriented to the unattended message if their name was mentioned. [ 17 ] The two main types of memory are short-term memory and long-term memory; however, short-term memory has become better understood to be working memory. Cognitive psychologists often study memory in terms of working memory . [ 18 ] Though working memory is often thought of as just short-term memory, it is more clearly defined as the ability to process and maintain temporary information in a wide range of everyday activities in the face of distraction. The famously known capacity of memory of 7 plus or minus 2 is a combination of both memories in working memory and long-term memory.

[ 20 ] This primacy and recency effect varies in intensity based on list length. [ 20 ] Its typical U-shaped curve can be disrupted by an attention-grabbing word; this is known as the Von Restorff effect . Many models of working memory have been made. One of the most regarded is the Baddeley and Hitch model of working memory . It takes into account both visual and auditory stimuli, long-term memory to use as a reference, and a central processor to combine and understand it all. [ 21 ] A large part of memory is forgetting, and there is a large debate among psychologists of decay theory versus interference theory . [ citation needed ] Modern conceptions of memory are usually about long-term memory and break it down into three main sub-classes. These three classes are somewhat hierarchical in nature, in terms of the level of conscious thought related to their use. [ 22 ] Perception involves both the physical senses (sight, smell, hearing, taste, touch, and proprioception ) as well as the cognitive processes involved in interpreting those senses. Essentially, it is how people come to understand the world around them through the interpretation of stimuli. [ 24 ] Early psychologists like Edward B.

[ 25 ] Current perspectives on perception within cognitive psychology tend to focus on particular ways in which the human mind interprets stimuli from the senses and how these interpretations affect behavior. An example of the way in which modern psychologists approach the study of perception is the research being done at the Center for Ecological Study of Perception and Action at the University of Connecticut (CESPA). One study at CESPA concerns ways in which individuals perceive their physical environment and how that influences their navigation through that environment. [ 26 ] Psychologists have had an interest in the cognitive processes involved with language that dates back to the 1870s, when Carl Wernicke proposed a model for the mental processing of language.

Cognitive psychologists may study language acquisition , [ 28 ] individual components of language formation (like phonemes ), [ 29 ] how language use is involved in mood , or numerous other related areas.

[ 28 ] Metacognition , in a broad sense, is the thoughts that a person has about their own thoughts. More specifically, metacognition includes things like: Much of the current study regarding metacognition within the field of cognitive psychology deals with its application within the area of education. Being able to increase a student's metacognitive abilities has been shown to have a significant impact on their learning and study habits. [ 31 ] One key aspect of this concept is the improvement of students' ability to set goals and self-regulate effectively to meet those goals. As a part of this process, it is also important to ensure that students are realistically evaluating their personal degree of knowledge and setting realistic goals (another metacognitive task). [ 32 ] Common phenomena related to metacognition include: Modern perspectives on cognitive psychology generally address cognition as a dual process theory , expounded upon by Daniel Kahneman in 2011. [ 33 ] Kahneman differentiated the two styles of processing more, calling them intuition and reasoning. Intuition (or system 1), similar to associative reasoning, was determined to be fast and automatic, usually with strong emotional bonds included in the reasoning process. Kahneman said that this kind of reasoning was based on formed habits and very difficult to change or manipulate. Reasoning (or system 2) was slower and much more volatile, being subject to conscious judgments and attitudes. [ 33"

[ 33 ] Following the cognitive revolution, and as a result of many of the principal discoveries to come out of the field of cognitive psychology, the discipline of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) evolved. Aaron T. Beck is generally regarded as the father of cognitive therapy , a particular type of CBT treatment. [ 34 ] His work in the areas of recognition and treatment of depression has gained worldwide recognition. In his 1987 book titled Cognitive Therapy of Depression , Beck puts forth three salient points with regard to his reasoning for the treatment of depression by means of therapy or therapy and antidepressants versus using a pharmacological-only approach: 1. Despite the prevalent use of antidepressants, the fact remains that not all patients respond to them. Beck cites (in 1987) that only 60 to 65% of patients respond to antidepressants, and recent meta-analyses (a statistical breakdown of multiple studies) show very similar numbers. [ 35 ] 2. Many of those who do respond to antidepressants end up not taking their medications, for various reasons. They may develop side-effects or have some form of personal objection to taking the drugs. 3. Beck posits that the use of psychotropic drugs may lead to an eventual breakdown in the individual's coping mechanisms . His theory is that the person essentially becomes reliant on the medication as a means of improving mood and fails to practice those coping techniques typically practiced by healthy individuals to alleviate the effects of depressive symptoms.

[ 36 ] Many facets of modern social psychology have roots in research done within the field of cognitive psychology. [ 37 ] [ 38 ] Social cognition is a specific sub-set of social psychology that concentrates on processes that have been of particular focus within cognitive psychology, specifically applied to human interactions. Gordon B. Moskowitz defines social cognition as \"... the study of the mental processes involved in perceiving, attending to, remembering, thinking about, and making sense of the people in our social world\". [ 39 ] The development of multiple social information processing (SIP) models has been influential in studies involving aggressive and anti-social behavior. Kenneth Dodge's SIP model is one of, if not the most, empirically supported models relating to aggression. Among his research, Dodge posits that children who possess a greater ability to process social information more often display higher levels of socially acceptable behavior; that the type of social interaction that children have affects their relationships. [ 40 ] His model asserts that there are five steps that an individual proceeds through when evaluating interactions with other individuals and that how the person interprets cues is key to their reactionary process.

One of the major paradigms of developmental psychology, the Theory of Mind (ToM), deals specifically with the ability of an individual to effectively understand and attribute cognition to those around them. This concept typically becomes fully apparent in children between the ages of 4 and 6. Essentially, before the child develops ToM, they are unable to understand that those around them can have different thoughts, ideas, or feelings than themselves. The development of ToM is a matter of metacognition , or thinking about one's thoughts. The child must be able to recognize that they have their own thoughts and in turn, that others possess thoughts of their own. [ 42 ] One of the foremost minds with regard to developmental psychology, Jean Piaget, focused much of his attention on cognitive development from birth through adulthood. Though there have been considerable challenges to parts of his stages of cognitive development , they remain a staple in the realm of education. Piaget's concepts and ideas predated the cognitive revolution but inspired a wealth of research in the field of cognitive psychology and many of his principles have been blended with modern theory to synthesize the predominant views of today.

[ 45 ] Cognitive psychology is considered a core aspect of cognitive science , the interdisciplinary study of mind and mental function, including how such functions implemented in brains and machines. Cognitive science, as a unitary field, integrates knowledge, theory and methodology from psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, philosophy, artificial intelligence, and anthropology. [ 46 ] It has been argued that cognitive science has been largely consumed by cognitive psychology, with some scholars even using the terms interchangeably [ 46 ] (see LeMoult & Gotlib [ 47 ] for an example). This largely results from early difficulties integrating the different fields of cognitive science (e.g. psychology and artificial intelligence), with the resulting divergence of terminology, methodology and theoretical approach over time rendering efforts at cohering the disciplines challenging. [ 46 ] Some observers have suggested that as cognitive psychology became a movement during the 1970s, the intricacies of the phenomena and processes it examined meant it also began to lose cohesion as a field of study. In Psychology: Pythagoras to Present , for example, John Malone writes: \"Examinations of late twentieth-century textbooks dealing with \"cognitive psychology\", \"human cognition\", \"cognitive science\" and the like quickly reveal that there are many, many varieties of cognitive psychology and very little agreement about exactly what may be its domain.\" [ 4 ] This misfortune produced competing models that questioned information-processing approaches to cognitive functioning such as Decision Making and Behavioral Sciences .

However, cognitive neuroscience continues to gather evidence of direct correlations between physiological brain activity and mental states, endorsing the basis for cognitive psychology.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] It assumes that behavior is either a reflex elicited by the pairing of certain antecedent stimuli in the environment, or a consequence of that individual's history, including especially reinforcement and punishment contingencies , together with the individual's current motivational state and controlling stimuli . Although behaviorists generally accept the important role of heredity in determining behavior, deriving from Skinner's two levels of selection (phylogeny and ontogeny), [ 3 ] they focus primarily on environmental events. The cognitive revolution of the late 20th century largely replaced behaviorism as an explanatory theory with cognitive psychology , which unlike behaviorism views internal mental states as explanations for observable behavior. Behaviorism emerged in the early 1900s as a reaction to depth psychology and other traditional forms of psychology, which often had difficulty making predictions that could be tested experimentally. It was derived from earlier research in the late nineteenth century, such as when Edward Thorndike pioneered the law of effect , a procedure that involved the use of consequences to strengthen or weaken behavior. With a 1924 publication, John B. Watson devised methodological behaviorism, which rejected introspective methods and sought to understand behavior by only measuring observable behaviors and events. It was not until 1945 that B. F. Skinner proposed that covert behavior—including cognition and emotions —are subject to the same controlling variables as observable behavior, [ 4 ] which became the basis for his philosophy called radical behaviorism .

The titles given to the various branches of behaviorism include: Two subtypes of theoretical behaviorism are: B. F. Skinner proposed radical behaviorism as the conceptual underpinning of the experimental analysis of behavior . This viewpoint differs from other approaches to behavioral research in various ways, but, most notably here, it contrasts with methodological behaviorism in accepting feelings, states of mind and introspection as behaviors also subject to scientific investigation. Like methodological behaviorism, it rejects the reflex as a model of all behavior, and it defends the science of behavior as complementary to but independent of physiology. Radical behaviorism overlaps considerably with other western philosophical positions, such as American pragmatism . [ 15 ] Although John B.

The pigeons were placed together in an operant chamber, where they were aggressive as a consequence of previous reinforcement in the environment. Through stimulus control and subsequent discrimination training, whenever Skinner turned off the green light, the pigeons came to notice that the food reinforcer is discontinued following each peck and responded without aggression. Skinner concluded that humans also learn aggression and possess such emotions (as well as other private events) no differently than do nonhuman animals. [ citation needed ] As experimental behavioral psychology is related to behavioral neuroscience , we can date the first researches in the area were done in the beginning of 19th century. [ 17 ] Later, this essentially philosophical position gained strength from the success of Skinner's early experimental work with rats and pigeons, summarized in his books The Behavior of Organisms and Schedules of Reinforcement.

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] Of particular importance was his concept of the operant response, of which the canonical example was the rat's lever-press. In contrast with the idea of a physiological or reflex response, an operant is a class of structurally distinct but functionally equivalent responses. For example, while a rat might press a lever with its left paw or its right paw or its tail, all of these responses operate on the world in the same way and have a common consequence. Operants are often thought of as species of responses, where the individuals differ but the class coheres in its function-shared consequences with operants and reproductive success with species. This is a clear distinction between Skinner's theory and S–R theory . Skinner's empirical work expanded on earlier research on trial-and-error learning by researchers such as Thorndike and Guthrie with both conceptual reformulations—Thorndike's notion of a stimulus-response \"association\" or \"connection\" was abandoned; and methodological ones—the use of the \"free operant\", so-called because the animal was now permitted to respond at its own rate rather than in a series of trials determined by the experimenter procedures. With this method, Skinner carried out substantial experimental work on the effects of different schedules and rates of reinforcement on the rates of operant responses made by rats and pigeons. He achieved remarkable success in training animals to perform unexpected responses, to emit large numbers of responses, and to demonstrate many empirical regularities at the purely behavioral level. This lent some credibility to his conceptual analysis. It is largely his conceptual analysis that made his work much more rigorous than his peers, a point which can be seen clearly in his seminal work Are Theories of Learning Necessary? in which he criticizes what he"

An important descendant of the experimental analysis of behavior is the Society for Quantitative Analysis of Behavior . [ 20 ] [ 21 ] As Skinner turned from experimental work to concentrate on the philosophical underpinnings of a science of behavior, his attention turned to human language with his 1957 book Verbal Behavior [ 22 ] and other language-related publications; [ 23 ] Verbal Behavior laid out a vocabulary and theory for functional analysis of verbal behavior, and was strongly criticized in a review by Noam Chomsky .

What was important for a behaviorist's analysis of human behavior was not language acquisition so much as the interaction between language and overt behavior. In an essay republished in his 1969 book Contingencies of Reinforcement , [ 23 ] Skinner took the view that humans could construct linguistic stimuli that would then acquire control over their behavior in the same way that external stimuli could. The possibility of such \"instructional control\" over behavior meant that contingencies of reinforcement would not always produce the same effects on human behavior as they reliably do in other animals. The focus of a radical behaviorist analysis of human behavior therefore shifted to an attempt to understand the interaction between instructional control and contingency control, and also to understand the behavioral processes that determine what instructions are constructed and what control they acquire over behavior. Recently, a new line of behavioral research on language was started under the name of relational frame theory . [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ] B. F. Skinner's book Verbal Behavior (1957) does not quite emphasize on language development, but to understand human behavior. Additionally, his work serves in understanding social interactions in the child's early developmental stages focusing on the topic of caregiver-infant interaction. [ 42 ] Skinner's functional analysis of verbal behavior terminology and theories is commonly used to understand the relationship between language development but was primarily designed to describe behaviors of interest and explain the cause of those behaviors.

However, there is a lack of supporting evidence where Skinner makes the statement. [ 42 ] Understanding language is a complex topic but can be understood through the use of two theories: innateness and acquisition. Both theories offer a different perspective whether language is inherently \"acquired\" or \"learned\". [ 43 ] Operant conditioning was developed by B.F. Skinner in 1938 and is form of learning in which the frequency of a behavior is controlled by consequences to change behavior. [ 44 ] [ 18 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] In other words, behavior is controlled by historical consequential contingencies, particularly reinforcement —a stimulus that increases the probability of performing behaviors, and punishment —a stimulus that decreases such probability. [ 44 ] The core tools of consequences are either positive (presenting stimuli following a response), or negative (withdrawn stimuli following a response). [ 47 ] The following descriptions explains the concepts of four common types of consequences in operant conditioning: [ 48 ] A classical experiment in operant conditioning, for example, is the Skinner Box , \"puzzle box\" or operant conditioning chamber to test the effects of operant conditioning principles on rats, cats and other species. From this experiment, he discovered that the rats learned very effectively if they were rewarded frequently with food. Skinner also found that he could shape (create new behavior) the rats' behavior through the use of rewards, which could, in turn, be applied to human learning as well.

Skinner's model was based on the premise that reinforcement is used for the desired actions or responses while punishment was used to stop the responses of the undesired actions that are not. This theory proved that humans or animals will repeat any action that leads to a positive outcome, and avoid any action that leads to a negative outcome. The experiment with the pigeons showed that a positive outcome leads to learned behavior since the pigeon learned to peck the disc in return for the reward of food. These historical consequential contingencies subsequently lead to (antecedent) stimulus control , but in contrast to respondent conditioning where antecedent stimuli elicit reflexive behavior, operant behavior is only emitted and therefore does not force its occurrence. It includes the following controlling stimuli: [ 48 ] Although operant conditioning plays the largest role in discussions of behavioral mechanisms, respondent conditioning (also called Pavlovian or classical conditioning) is also an important behavior-analytic process that needs not refer to mental or other internal processes. Pavlov's experiments with dogs provide the most familiar example of the classical conditioning procedure. In the beginning, the dog was provided meat (unconditioned stimulus, UCS, naturally elicit a response that is not controlled) to eat, resulting in increased salivation (unconditioned response, UCR, which means that a response is naturally caused by UCS). Afterward, a bell ring was presented together with food to the dog.

Although bell ring was a neutral stimulus (NS, meaning that the stimulus did not have any effect), dog would start to salivate when only hearing a bell ring after a number of pairings. Eventually, the neutral stimulus (bell ring) became conditioned. Therefore, salivation was elicited as a conditioned response (the response same as the unconditioned response), pairing up with meat—the conditioned stimulus) [ 51 ] Although Pavlov proposed some tentative physiological processes that might be involved in classical conditioning, these have not been confirmed. [ 52 ] The idea of classical conditioning helped behaviorist John Watson discover the key mechanism behind how humans acquire the behaviors that they do, which was to find a natural reflex that produces the response being considered. Watson 's \"Behaviorist Manifesto\" has three aspects that deserve special recognition: one is that psychology should be purely objective, with any interpretation of conscious experience being removed, thus leading to psychology as the \"science of behavior\"; the second one is that the goals of psychology should be to predict and control behavior (as opposed to describe and explain conscious mental states); the third one is that there is no notable distinction between human and non-human behavior. Following Darwin's theory of evolution, this would simply mean that human behavior is just a more complex version in respect to behavior displayed by other species.

Skinner's radical behaviorism reintroduced reference to inner states and also advocated for the study of thoughts and feelings as behaviors subject to the same mechanisms as external behavior. [ 57 ] [ 58 ] Behaviorism takes a functional view of behavior. According to Edmund Fantino and colleagues: \"Behavior analysis has much to offer the study of phenomena normally dominated by cognitive and social psychologists. We hope that successful application of behavioral theory and methodology will not only shed light on central problems in judgment and choice but will also generate greater appreciation of the behavioral approach.\" [ 59 ] Behaviorist sentiments are not uncommon within philosophy of language and analytic philosophy . It is sometimes argued that Ludwig Wittgenstein defended a logical behaviorist position [ 10 ] (e.g., the beetle in a box argument). In logical positivism (as held, e.g., by Rudolf Carnap [ 10 ] and Carl Hempel ), [ 10 ] the meaning of psychological statements are their verification conditions, which consist of performed overt behavior. W. V. O. Quine made use of a type of behaviorism, [ 10 ] influenced by some of Skinner's ideas, in his own work on language.

Gilbert Ryle defended a distinct strain of philosophical behaviorism, sketched in his book The Concept of Mind . [ 10 ] Ryle's central claim was that instances of dualism frequently represented \" category mistakes \", and hence that they were really misunderstandings of the use of ordinary language. Daniel Dennett likewise acknowledges himself to be a type of behaviorist, [ 60 ] though he offers extensive criticism of radical behaviorism and refutes Skinner's rejection of the value of intentional idioms and the possibility of free will. [ 61 ] This is Dennett's main point in \"Skinner Skinned\". Dennett argues that there is a crucial difference between explaining and explaining away... If our explanation of apparently rational behavior turns out to be extremely simple, we may want to say that the behavior was not really rational after all. But if the explanation is very complex and intricate, we may want to say not that the behavior is not rational, but that we now have a better understanding of what rationality consists in. (Compare: if we find out how a computer program solves problems in linear algebra, we don't say it's not really solving them, we just say we know how it does it. On the other hand, in cases like Weizenbaum's ELIZA program, the explanation of how the computer carries on a conversation is so simple that the right thing to say seems to be that the machine isn't really carrying on a conversation, it's just a trick.) — Curtis Brown, \"Behaviorism: Skinner"

This view is inconsistent with Skinner's complete description of behavior as delineated in other works, including his 1981 article \"Selection by Consequences\". [ 65 ] Skinner proposed that a complete account of behavior requires understanding of selection history at three levels: biology (the natural selection or phylogeny of the animal); behavior (the reinforcement history or ontogeny of the behavioral repertoire of the animal); and for some species, culture (the cultural practices of the social group to which the animal belongs). This whole organism then interacts with its environment. Molecular behaviorists use notions from melioration theory , negative power function discounting or additive versions of negative power function discounting. [ 66 ] According to Moore, [ 67 ] the perseverance in a molecular examination of behavior may be sign of a desire for an in-depth understanding, maybe to identify any underlying mechanism or components that contribute to comples actions. This strategy might involve elements, procedure, or variables that contribute to behaviorism. Molar behaviorists, such as Howard Rachlin , Richard Herrnstein , and William Baum, argue that behavior cannot be understood by focusing on events in the moment.

[ 7 ] In the mid-18th century, Jean Jacques Rousseau described three stages of development: infants (infancy), puer (childhood) and adolescence in Emile: Or, On Education . Rousseau's ideas were adopted and supported by educators at the time. Developmental psychology generally focuses on how and why certain changes ( cognitive , social, intellectual, personality ) occur over time in the course of a human life. Many theorists have made a profound contribution to this area of psychology. One of them is the psychologist Erik Erikson, [ 8 ] who created a model of eight phases of psychosocial development.

[ 7 ] Sigmund Freud developed a theory that suggested that humans behave as they do because they are constantly seeking pleasure. This process of seeking pleasure changes through stages because people evolve . Each period of seeking pleasure that a person experiences is represented by a stage of psychosexual development. These stages symbolize the process of arriving at becoming a maturing adult. [ 10 ] The first is the oral stage , which begins at birth and ends around a year and a half of age. During the oral stage, the child finds pleasure in behaviors like sucking or other behaviors with the mouth. The second is the anal stage , from about a year or a year and a half to three years of age. During the anal stage, the child defecates from the anus and is often fascinated with its defecation. This period of development often occurs during the time when the child is being toilet-trained. The child becomes interested in feces and urine. Children begin to see themselves as independent from their parents. They begin to desire assertiveness and autonomy.

Stage five is the genital stage , which takes place from puberty until adulthood. During the genital stage, puberty begins to occur. [ 11 ] Children have now matured, and begin to think about other people instead of just themselves. Pleasure comes from feelings of affection from other people. Freud believed there is tension between the conscious and unconscious because the conscious tries to hold back what the unconscious tries to express. To explain this, he developed three personality structures: id, ego, and superego. The id, the most primitive of the three, functions according to the pleasure principle: seek pleasure and avoid pain. [ 12 ] The superego plays the critical and moralizing role, while the ego is the organized, realistic part that mediates between the desires of the id and the superego. [ 13 ] Jean Piaget , a Swiss theorist, posited that children learn by actively constructing knowledge through their interactions with their physical and social environments.

The child's resolution of these contradictions led to more integrated and advanced forms of interaction, a developmental process that he called \"equilibration.\" Piaget argued that intellectual development takes place through a series of stages generated through the equilibration process. Each stage consists of steps the child must master before moving to the next step. He believed that these stages are not separate from one another, but rather that each stage builds on the previous one in a continuous learning process. He proposed four stages: sensorimotor , pre-operational , concrete operational , and formal operational . Though he did not believe these stages occurred at any given age, many studies have determined when these cognitive abilities should take place. [ 15 ] Piaget claimed that logic and morality develop through constructive stages. [ 16 ] Expanding on Piaget's work, Lawrence Kohlberg determined that the process of moral development was principally concerned with justice, and that it continued throughout the individual's lifetime. [ 17 ] He suggested three levels of moral reasoning: pre-conventional moral reasoning, conventional moral reasoning, and post-conventional moral reasoning. The pre-conventional moral reasoning is typical of children and is characterized by reasoning that is based on rewards and punishments associated with different courses of action. Conventional moral reasoning occurs during late childhood and early adolescence and is characterized by reasoning based on the rules and conventions of society. Lastly, post-conventional moral reasoning is a stage during which the individual sees society's rules and conventions as relative and subjective,"

The Heinz Dilemma involves Heinz's wife dying from cancer and Heinz having the dilemma to save his wife by stealing a drug. Preconventional morality, conventional morality, and post-conventional morality applies to Heinz's situation. [ 19 ] German-American psychologist Erik Erikson and his collaborator and wife, Joan Erikson , posits eight stages of individual human development influenced by biological, psychological, and social factors throughout the lifespan. [ 8 ] At each stage the person must resolve a challenge, or an existential dilemma. Successful resolution of the dilemma results in the person ingraining a positive virtue, but failure to resolve the fundamental challenge of that stage reinforces negative perceptions of the person or the world around them and the person's personal development is unable to progress. [ 8 ] The first stage, \"Trust vs. Mistrust\", takes place in infancy . The positive virtue for the first stage is hope, in the infant learning whom to trust and having hope for a supportive group of people to be there for him/her. The second stage is \"Autonomy vs. Shame and Doubt\" with the positive virtue being will.

The eighth stage is \"Ego Integrity vs. Despair\". When one grows old, they look back on their life and contemplate their successes and failures. If they resolve this positively, the virtue of wisdom is gained. This is also the stage when one can gain a sense of closure and accept death without regret or fear. [ 20 ] Michael Commons enhanced and simplified Bärbel Inhelder and Piaget's developmental theory and offers a standard method of examining the universal pattern of development. The Model of Hierarchical Complexity (MHC) is not based on the assessment of domain-specific information, It divides the Order of Hierarchical Complexity of tasks to be addressed from the Stage performance on those tasks. A stage is the order hierarchical complexity of the tasks the participant's successfully addresses. He expanded Piaget's original eight stage (counting the half stages) to seventeen stages. The stages are: The order of hierarchical complexity of tasks predicts how difficult the performance is with an R ranging from 0.9 to 0.98. In the MHC, there are three main axioms for an order to meet in order for the higher order task to coordinate the next lower order task. Axioms are rules that are followed to determine how the MHC orders actions to form a hierarchy. These axioms are: a) defined in terms of tasks at the next lower order of hierarchical complexity task action; b) defined as the higher order task action that organizes two or more less complex actions; that is, the more complex action specifies the way in which the less complex actions combine; c) defined as the lower order task actions"

American Psychological Association: 9– 68. doi : 10.1037/h0100589 . Ecological systems theory, originally formulated by Urie Bronfenbrenner , specifies four types of nested environmental systems, with bi-directional influences within and between the systems. The four systems are microsystem, mesosystem, exosystem, and macrosystem. Each system contains roles, norms and rules that can powerfully shape development. The microsystem is the direct environment in our lives such as our home and school. Mesosystem is how relationships connect to the microsystem. Exosystem is a larger social system where the child plays no role. Macrosystem refers to the cultural values, customs and laws of society. [ 21 ] The microsystem is the immediate environment surrounding and influencing the individual (example: school or the home setting). The mesosystem is the combination of two microsystems and how they influence each other (example: sibling relationships at home vs. peer relationships at school). The exosystem is the interaction among two or more settings that are indirectly linked (example: a father's job requiring more overtime ends up influencing his daughter's performance in school because he can no longer help with her homework). The macrosystem is broader taking into account social economic status, culture, beliefs, customs and morals (example: a child from a wealthier family sees a peer from a less wealthy family as inferior for that"

Lastly, the chronosystem refers to the chronological nature of life events and how they interact and change the individual and their circumstances through transition (example: a mother losing her own mother to illness and no longer having that support in her life). [ 15 ] Since its publication in 1979, Bronfenbrenner's major statement of this theory, The Ecology of Human Development , [ 22 ] has had widespread influence on the way psychologists and others approach the study of human beings and their environments. As a result of this conceptualization of development, these environments—from the family to economic and political structures—have come to be viewed as part of the life course from childhood through to adulthood. [ 23 ] Lev Vygotsky was a Russian theorist from the Soviet era, who posited that children learn through hands-on experience and social interactions with members of their culture. [ 24 ] Vygotsky believed that a child's development should be examined during problem-solving activities. [ 25 ] Unlike Piaget, he claimed that timely and sensitive intervention by adults when a child is on the edge of learning a new task (called the \"zone of proximal development\") could help children learn new tasks. Zone of proximal development is a tool used to explain the learning of children and collaborating problem solving activities with an adult or peer.

[ 26 ] Vygotsky was strongly focused on the role of culture in determining the child's pattern of development, arguing that development moves from the social level to the individual level. [ 26 ] In other words, Vygotsky claimed that psychology should focus on the progress of human consciousness through the relationship of an individual and their environment. [ 27 ] He felt that if scholars continued to disregard this connection, then this disregard would inhibit the full comprehension of the human consciousness. [ 27 ] Constructivism is a paradigm in psychology that characterizes learning as a process of actively constructing knowledge. Individuals create meaning for themselves or make sense of new information by selecting, organizing, and integrating information with other knowledge, often in the context of social interactions. Constructivism can occur in two ways: individual and social. Individual constructivism is when a person constructs knowledge through cognitive processes of their own experiences rather than by memorizing facts provided by others. Social constructivism is when individuals construct knowledge through an interaction between the knowledge they bring to a situation and social or cultural exchanges within that content.

[ 28 ] Jean Piaget, a Swiss developmental psychologist, proposed that learning is an active process because children learn through experience and make mistakes and solve problems. Piaget proposed that learning should be whole by helping students understand that meaning is constructed. [ 29 ] Evolutionary developmental psychology is a research paradigm that applies the basic principles of Darwinian evolution , particularly natural selection , to understand the development of human behavior and cognition. It involves the study of both the genetic and environmental mechanisms that underlie the development of social and cognitive competencies, as well as the epigenetic ( gene-environment interactions ) processes that adapt these competencies to local conditions. [ 30 ] EDP considers both the reliably developing, species-typical features of ontogeny (developmental adaptations), as well as individual differences in behavior, from an evolutionary perspective. While evolutionary views tend to regard most individual differences as the result of either random genetic noise (evolutionary byproducts) [ 31 ] and/or idiosyncrasies (for example, peer groups, education, neighborhoods, and chance encounters) [ 32 ] rather than products of natural selection, EDP asserts that natural selection can favor the emergence of individual differences via \"adaptive developmental plasticity\".

[ 1 ] Although studying many of the same substantive topics as its counterpart in the field of sociology, psychological social psychology places more emphasis on the individual, rather than society; the influence of social structure and culture on individual outcomes, such as personality , behavior , and one's position in social hierarchies . Social psychologists typically explain human behavior as a result of the relationship between mental states and social situations, studying the social conditions under which thoughts, feelings, and behaviors occur, and how these variables influence social interactions . [ 2 ] In the 19th century, social psychology began to emerge from the larger field of psychology . At the time, many psychologists were concerned with developing concrete explanations for the different aspects of human nature . They attempted to discover concrete cause-and-effect relationships that explained social interactions. In order to do so, they applied the scientific method to human behavior. [ 3 ] One of the first published studies in the field was Norman Triplett 's 1898 experiment on the phenomenon of social facilitation . [ 4 ] These psychological experiments later went on to form the foundation of much of 20th century social psychological findings. According to Wolfgang Stroebe , modern social psychology began in 1924 with the publication of a classic textbook by Floyd Allport , which defined the field as the experimental study of social behavior.

Following the war, researchers became interested in a variety of social problems, including issues of gender and racial prejudice . [ 7 ] Social stigma , [ 8 ] which refers to the disapproval or discrimination against individuals based on perceived differences, became increasingly prevalent as societies sought to redefine norms and group boundaries after the war. During the years immediately following World War II , there were frequent collaborations between psychologists and sociologists . The two disciplines, however, have become increasingly specialized and isolated from each other in recent years, with sociologists generally focusing on high-level, large-scale examinations of society, and psychologists generally focusing on more small-scale studies of individual human behaviors. [ 9 ] During the 1960s, there was growing interest in topics such as cognitive dissonance , bystander intervention , and aggression . These developments were part of a trend of increasingly sophisticated laboratory experiments using college students as participants and analysis of variance designs. [ 10 ] In the 1970s, a number of conceptual challenges to social psychology emerged over issues such as ethical concerns about laboratory experimentation, whether attitudes could accurately predict behavior, and to what extent science could be done in a cultural context.

[ 12 ] At present, ethical standards regulate research, and pluralistic and multicultural perspectives to the social sciences have emerged. Most modern researchers in the 21st century are interested in phenomena such as attribution , social cognition , and self-concept . [ 13 ] During the COVID-19 pandemic , social psychologists examined the effects of social isolation, fear, and misinformation on collective behavior. Research also focused on how pandemic-related stress affected mental health and social cohesion.

[ 15 ] In social psychology, an attitude is a learned, global evaluation that influences thought and action. [ 16 ] Attitudes are basic expressions of approval and disapproval or likes and dislikes. For example, enjoying chocolate ice cream or endorsing the values of a particular political party are examples of attitudes.

According to this theory, attitudes must be logically consistent with each other. Noticing incongruence among one's attitudes leads to an uncomfortable state of tension, which may motivate a change in attitudes or behavior. [ 18 ] Research on attitudes has examined the distinction between traditional, self-reported attitudes and implicit, unconscious attitudes . Experiments using the Implicit Association Test (IAT) , for instance, have found that people often demonstrate implicit bias against other races, even when their explicit responses profess impartiality. [ 19 ] Likewise, one study found that in interracial interactions, explicit attitudes correlate with verbal behavior, while implicit attitudes correlate with nonverbal behavior. [ 20 ] Attitudes are also involved in several other areas of the discipline, such as conformity , interpersonal attraction , social perception, and prejudice . [ 21 ] Persuasion is an active method of influencing that attempts to guide people toward the adoption of an attitude, idea, or behavior by rational or emotive means. Persuasion relies on appeals rather than strong pressure or coercion . The process of persuasion has been found to be influenced by numerous variables that generally fall into one of five major categories: [ 22 ] Dual-process theories of persuasion (such as the elaboration likelihood model ) maintain that persuasion is mediated by two separate routes: central and peripheral. The central route of persuasion is influenced by facts and results in longer-lasting change, but requires motivation to process. The peripheral route is influenced by superficial factors (e.g. smiling, clothing) and results in shorter-lasting change, but does not require as much motivation to process.

[ 24 ] Much research rests on the assertion that people think about other people differently than they do non-social, or non-human, targets. [ 25 ] This assertion is supported by the social-cognitive deficits exhibited by people with Williams syndrome and autism . [ 26 ] A major research topic in social cognition is attribution . [ 27 ] Attributions are explanations of behavior, either one's own behavior or the behavior of others. One element of attribution ascribes the cause of behavior to internal and external factors. An internal, or dispositional, attribution reasons that a behavior is caused by inner traits such as personality, disposition, character, and ability. An external, or situational, attribution reasons that a behavior is caused by situational elements such as the weather. [ 28 ] : 111 A second element of attribution ascribes the cause of behavior to stable and unstable factors (i.e., whether the behavior will be repeated or changed under similar circumstances). Individuals also attribute causes of behavior to controllable and uncontrollable factors (i.e., how much control one has over the situation at hand). Numerous biases in the attribution process have been discovered. For instance, the fundamental attribution error is the bias towards making dispositional attributions for other people's behavior.

[ 28 ] : 107 The self-serving bias is the tendency to attribute dispositional causes for successes, and situational causes for failure, particularly when self-esteem is threatened. This leads to assuming one's successes are from innate traits, and one's failures are due to situations. [ 28 ] : 109 Heuristics are cognitive shortcuts which are used to make decisions in lieu of conscious reasoning. The availability heuristic occurs when people estimate the probability of an outcome based on how easy that outcome is to imagine. As such, vivid or highly memorable possibilities will be perceived as more likely than those that are harder to picture or difficult to understand. The representativeness heuristic is a shortcut people use to categorize something based on how similar it is to a prototype they know of. [ 28 ] : 63 Several other biases have been found by social cognition researchers. The hindsight bias is a false memory of having predicted events, or an exaggeration of actual predictions, after becoming aware of the outcome. The confirmation bias is a type of bias leading to the tendency to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms one's preconceptions.

[ 31 ] This type of schema is a stereotype , a generalized set of beliefs about a particular group of people (when incorrect, an ultimate attribution error ). Stereotypes are often related to negative or preferential attitudes and behavior. Schemas for behaviors (e.g., going to a restaurant, doing laundry) are known as scripts . [ 32 ] Self-concept is the whole sum of beliefs that people have about themselves. The self-concept is made up of cognitive aspects called self-schemas —beliefs that people have about themselves and that guide the processing of self-referential information. [ 33 ] For example, an athlete at a university would have multiple selves that would process different information pertinent to each self: the student would be oneself, who would process information pertinent to a student (taking notes in class, completing a homework assignment, etc.); the athlete would be the self who processes information about things related to being an athlete. These selves are part of one's identity and the self-referential information is that which relies on the appropriate self to process and react to it.

[ 35 ] Social influence is an overarching term that denotes the persuasive effects people have on each other. It is seen as a fundamental concept in social psychology. The study of it overlaps considerably with research on attitudes and persuasion. The three main areas of social influence include conformity , compliance , and obedience . Social influence is also closely related to the study of group dynamics, as most effects of influence are strongest when they take place in social groups. [ 36 ] The first major area of social influence is conformity. Conformity is defined as the tendency to act or think like other members of a group. The identity of members within a group (i.e., status), similarity, expertise, as well as cohesion, prior commitment, and accountability to the group help to determine the level of conformity of an individual. Conformity is often driven by two types of social influences: informational social influence , which involves conforming to gain accurate information, and normative social influence, which involves conforming to be accepted or liked by the group. [ 37 ] Individual variations among group members play a key role in the dynamic of how willing people will be to conform.

Two common compliance strategies are 'foot-in-the-door,' which involves getting a person to agree to a small request to increase the likelihood of agreeing to a larger one, and 'door-in-the-face,' which involves making a large request that is likely to be refused to make a subsequent smaller request more likely to be accepted. The foot-in-the-door technique is a compliance method in which the persuader requests a small favor and then follows up with a larger favor (e.g., asking for the time and then asking for ten dollars). A related trick is the bait and switch , which is a disingenuous sales strategy that involves enticing potential customers with advertisements of low-priced items which turn out to be unavailable in order to sell a more expensive item. [ 39 ] The third major form of social influence is obedience ; this is a change in behavior that is the result of a direct order or command from another person. Obedience as a form of compliance was dramatically highlighted by the Milgram study , wherein people were ready to administer shocks to a person in distress on a researcher's command.

Similarly, people may expect hostility in others and induce this hostility by their own behavior. [ 28 ] : 18 Psychologists have spent decades studying the power of social influence, and the way in which it manipulates people's opinions and behavior. Specifically, social influence refers to the way in which individuals change their ideas and actions to meet the demands of a social group, received authority, social role, or a minority within a group wielding influence over the majority. [ 40 ] Social psychologists study group-related phenomena such as the behavior of crowds . A group can be defined as two or more individuals who are connected to each other by social relationships . [ 41 ] Groups tend to interact, influence each other, and share a common identity. They have a number of emergent qualities that distinguish them from coincidental, temporary gatherings, which are termed social aggregates: [ 41 ] The shared social identity of individuals within a group influences intergroup behavior , which denotes the way in which groups behave towards and perceive each other.

[ 42 ] Groups often moderate and improve decision making , [ 43 ] and are frequently relied upon for these benefits, such as in committees and juries. Groups also affect performance and productivity . Social facilitation, for example, is a tendency to work harder and faster in the presence of others. Another important concept in this area is deindividuation , a reduced state of self-awareness that can be caused by feelings of anonymity. Deindividuation is associated with uninhibited and sometimes dangerous behavior. It is common in crowds and mobs, but it can also be caused by a disguise, a uniform, alcohol, dark environments, or online anonymity. [ 44 ] [ 45 ] A major area of study of people's relations to each other is interpersonal attraction, which refers to all factors that lead people to like each other, establish relationships, and in some cases fall in love. Several general principles of attraction have been discovered by social psychologists. One of the most important factors in interpersonal attraction is how similar two particular people are. The more similar two people are in general attitudes, backgrounds, environments, worldviews, and other traits, the more likely they will be attracted to each other. [ 46 ] Physical attractiveness is an important element of romantic relationships, particularly in the early stages characterized by high levels of passion . Later on, similarity and other compatibility factors become more important, and the type of love people experience shifts from passionate to companionate. In 1986,"

Later on, similarity and other compatibility factors become more important, and the type of love people experience shifts from passionate to companionate. In 1986, Robert Sternberg suggested that there are actually three components of love: intimacy, passion, and commitment. [ 47 ] When two (or more) people experience all three, they are said to be in a state of consummate love. According to social exchange theory , relationships are based on rational choice and cost-benefit analysis. A person may leave a relationship if their partner's \"costs\" begin to outweigh their benefits, especially if there are good alternatives available. This theory is similar to the minimax principle proposed by mathematicians and economists . With time, long-term relationships tend to become communal rather than simply based on exchange. [ 48 ] Social psychology is an empirical science that attempts to answer questions about human behavior by testing hypotheses. Careful attention to research design, sampling, and statistical analysis is important in social psychology. Whenever possible, social psychologists rely on controlled experimentation , which requires the manipulation of one or more independent variables in order to examine the effect on a dependent variable . Experiments are useful in social psychology because they are high in internal validity , meaning that they are free from the influence of confounding or extraneous variables, and so are more likely to accurately indicate a causal relationship. However, the small samples used in controlled experiments are typically low in external validity , or the degree to which the results can be generalized to the larger population.

It aims to show how people are individually different due to psychological forces. [ 1 ] Its areas of focus include: \"Personality\" is a dynamic and organized set of characteristics possessed by an individual that uniquely influences their environment, cognition , emotions , motivations , and behaviors in various situations. The word personality originates from the Latin persona , which means \" mask \". Personality also pertains to the pattern of thoughts , feelings , social adjustments , and behaviors persistently exhibited over time that strongly influences one's expectations, self-perceptions , values , and attitudes . [ 2 ] Environmental and situational effects on behaviour are influenced by psychological mechanisms within a person. [ 3 ] Personality also predicts human reactions to other people, problems, and stress . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Gordon Allport (1937) described two major ways to study personality: the nomothetic and the idiographic . Nomothetic psychology seeks general laws that can be applied to many different people, such as the principle of self-actualization or the trait of extraversion . Idiographic psychology is an attempt to understand the unique aspects of a particular individual. The study of personality has a broad and varied history in psychology, with an abundance of theoretical traditions. The major theories include dispositional (trait) perspective, psychodynamic , humanistic, biological, behaviorist , evolutionary , and social learning perspective.

Many of the ideas conceptualized by historical and modern personality theorists stem from the basic philosophical assumptions they hold. The study of personality is not a purely empirical discipline, as it brings in elements of art , science , and philosophy to draw general conclusions. The following five categories are some of the most fundamental philosophical assumptions on which theorists disagree: [ 6 ] Personality type refers to the psychological classification of people into different classes. Personality types are distinguished from personality traits , which come in different degrees. For example, according to type theories, there are two types of people, introverts and extroverts. According to trait theories, introversion and extroversion are part of a continuous dimension with many people in the middle. Personality is complex; a typical theory of personality contains several propositions or sub-theories, often growing over time as more psychologists explore the theory. [ 10 ] The most widely accepted empirical model of durable, universal personality descriptors is the system of Big Five personality traits : conscientiousness , agreeableness , neuroticism , openness to experience , and extraversion-introversion . It is based on cluster analysis of verbal descriptions in self-reporting surveys. These traits demonstrate considerable genetic heritability .

An influential European tradition of psychological types originated in the theoretical work of Carl Jung , [ 11 ] specifically in his 1921 book Psychologische Typen ( Psychological Types ), and William Marston . [ 12 ] Building on the writings and observations of Jung during World War II, Isabel Briggs Myers and her mother, Katharine C.

Later on many other tests were developed on this model e.g. Golden, PTI-Pro and JTI. Theories could also be considered an \"approach\" to personality or psychology and is generally referred to as a model. The model is an older and more theoretical approach to personality, accepting extroversion and introversion as basic psychological orientations in connection with two pairs of psychological functions: Briggs and Myers also added another personality dimension to their type indicator to measure whether a person prefers to use a judging or perceiving function when interacting with the external world.

[ 13 ] This personality typology has some aspects of a trait theory: it explains people's behavior in terms of opposite fixed characteristics. In these more traditional models, the sensing/intuition preference is considered the most basic, dividing people into \"N\" (intuitive) or \"S\" (sensing) personality types. An \"N\" is further assumed to be guided either by thinking or feeling and divided into the \"NT\" (scientist, engineer) or \"NF\" (author, humanitarian) temperament. An \"S\", in contrast, is assumed to be guided more by the judgment/perception axis and thus divided into the \"SJ\" (guardian, traditionalist) or \"SP\" (performer, artisan) temperament. These four are considered basic, with the other two factors in each case (including always extraversion/introversion) less important. Critics of this traditional view have observed that the types can be quite strongly stereotyped by professions (although neither Myers nor Keirsey engaged in such stereotyping in their type descriptions), [ 13 ] and thus may arise more from the need to categorize people for purposes of guiding their career choice. [ 16 ] This among other objections led to the emergence of the five-factor view, which is less concerned with behavior under work conditions and more concerned with behavior in personal and emotional circumstances.

There was also a Type AB mixed profile. Health Psychology, a field of study, has been influenced by the Type A and Type B personality theories, which reveal how personality traits can impact cardiovascular health. Type A individuals, known for their competitiveness and urgency, may increase the risk of conditions like high blood pressure and coronary heart disease. [ 18 ] Day and Jreige (2002) investigate the Type A behavior pattern as a mediator in the relationship between job stressors and psychosocial outcomes. Their study, published in the Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, demonstrates that individuals exhibiting Type A characteristics are more susceptible to adverse psychosocial effects, such as increased stress and lower job satisfaction, when exposed to workplace stressors. This research highlights the importance of considering personality traits in managing occupational health.

In this circumplex model, the six types are represented as a hexagon, with adjacent types more closely related than those more distant. The model is widely used in vocational counseling. Psychoanalytic theories explain human behavior in terms of the interaction of various components of personality. Sigmund Freud was the founder of this school of thought. He drew on the physics of his day (thermodynamics) to coin the term psychodynamics . Based on the idea of converting heat into mechanical energy, Freud proposed psychic energy could be converted into behavior. His theory places central importance on dynamic, unconscious psychological conflicts. [ 20 ] Freud divides human personality into three significant components: the id, ego and super-ego . The id acts according to the pleasure principle , demanding immediate gratification of its needs regardless of external environment; the ego then must emerge in order to realistically meet the wishes and demands of the id in accordance with the outside world, adhering to the reality principle . Finally, the superego (conscience) inculcates moral judgment and societal rules upon the ego, thus forcing the demands of the id to be met not only realistically but morally. The superego is the last function of the personality to develop, and is the embodiment of parental/social ideals established during childhood. According to Freud, personality is based on the dynamic interactions of these three components. ["

[ 21 ] Freud's broad understanding of sexuality included all kinds of pleasurable feelings experienced by the human body. Freud proposed five psychosexual stages of personality development. He believed adult personality is dependent upon early childhood experiences and largely determined by age five. [ 21 ] Fixations that develop during the infantile stage contribute to adult personality and behavior. [ 22 ] One of Sigmund Freud's earlier associates, Alfred Adler , agreed with Freud that early childhood experiences are important to development, and believed birth order may influence personality development. Adler believed that the oldest child was the individual who would set high achievement goals in order to gain attention lost when the younger siblings were born. He believed the middle children were competitive and ambitious. He reasoned that this behavior was motivated by the idea of surpassing the firstborn's achievements. He added, however, that the middle children were often not as concerned about the glory attributed to their behavior. He also believed the youngest would be more dependent and sociable.

Narcissism is the exaggerated sense of self in which one is believed to exist in order to protect one's low self-esteem and sense of worthlessness. Kohut had a significant impact on the field by extending Freud's theory of narcissism and introducing what he called the 'self-object transferences' of mirroring and idealization. In other words, children need to idealize and emotionally \"sink into\" and identify with the idealized competence of admired figures such as parents or older siblings. They also need to have their self-worth mirrored by these people. Such experiences allow them to thereby learn the self-soothing and other skills that are necessary for the development of a healthy sense of self. Another important figure in the world of personality theory is Karen Horney . She is credited with the development of \"Feminist Psychology\". She disagrees with Freud on some key points, one being that women's personalities are not just a function of \"Penis Envy\", but that girl children have separate and different psychic lives unrelated to how they feel about their fathers or primary male role models. She talks about three basic Neurotic needs \"Basic Anxiety \", \"Basic Hostility\" and \"Basic Evil\".

Behaviorists explain personality in terms of the effects external stimuli have on behavior. The approaches used to evaluate the behavioral aspect of personality are known as behavioral theories or learning-conditioning theories. These approaches were a radical shift away from Freudian philosophy. One of the major tenets of this concentration of personality psychology is a strong emphasis on scientific thinking and experimentation. This school of thought was developed by B. F. Skinner who put forth a model which emphasized the mutual interaction of the person or \"the organism\" with its environment. Skinner believed children do bad things because the behavior obtains attention that serves as a reinforcer. For example: a child cries because the child's crying in the past has led to attention. These are the response , and consequences . The response is the child crying, and the attention that child gets is the reinforcing consequence. According to this theory, people's behavior is formed by processes such as operant conditioning . Skinner put forward a \"three term contingency model\" which helped promote analysis of behavior based on the \"Stimulus - Response - Consequence Model\" in which the critical question is: \"Under which circumstances or antecedent 'stimuli' does the organism engage in a particular behavior or 'response', which in turn produces a particular 'consequence'?\" [ 24 ] Richard Herrnstein extended this theory by accounting for attitudes and traits.

An attitude develops as the response strength (the tendency to respond) in the presences of a group of stimuli become stable. Rather than describing conditionable traits in non-behavioral language, response strength in a given situation accounts for the environmental portion. Herrnstein also saw traits as having a large genetic or biological component, as do most modern behaviorists. [ 24 ] Ivan Pavlov is another notable influence. He is well known for his classical conditioning experiments involving dogs, which led him to discover the foundation of behaviorism. [ 24 ] In cognitive theory, behavior is explained as guided by cognitions (e.g. expectations) about the world, especially those about other people. Cognitive theories are theories of personality that emphasize cognitive processes, such as thinking and judging. Albert Bandura , a social learning theorist suggested the forces of memory and emotions worked in conjunction with environmental influences. Bandura was known mostly for his \" Bobo doll experiment \". During these experiments, Bandura video taped a college student kicking and verbally abusing a bobo doll. He then showed this video to a class of kindergarten children who were getting ready to go out to play. When they entered the play room, they saw bobo dolls, and some hammers. The people observing these children at play saw a group of children beating the doll. He called this study and his findings observational learning , or modeling .

Baron relates early development of cognitive approaches of personality to ego psychology . More central to this field have been: Various scales have been developed to assess both attributional style and locus of control . Locus of control scales include those used by Rotter and later by Duttweiler, the Nowicki and Strickland (1973) Locus of Control Scale for Children and various locus of control scales specifically in the health domain, most famously that of Kenneth Wallston and his colleagues, The Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale.

[ 32 ] Recognition that the tendency to believe that hard work and persistence often results in attainment of life and academic goals has influenced formal educational and counseling efforts with students of various ages and in various settings since the 1970s research about achievement.

His work refers to \"Cognitive Affective Units\", and considers factors such as encoding of stimuli, affect, goal-setting, and self-regulatory beliefs. The term \"Cognitive Affective Units\" shows how his approach considers affect as well as cognition. Cognitive-Experiential Self-Theory (CEST) is another cognitive personality theory. Developed by Seymour Epstein, CEST argues that humans operate by way of two independent information processing systems: experiential system and rational system. The experiential system is fast and emotion-driven. The rational system is slow and logic-driven. These two systems interact to determine our goals, thoughts, and behavior. [ 36 ] Personal construct psychology (PCP) is a theory of personality developed by the American psychologist George Kelly in the 1950s. Kelly's fundamental view of personality was that people are like naive scientists who see the world through a particular lens, based on their uniquely organized systems of construction, which they use to anticipate events. But because people are naive scientists, they sometimes employ systems for construing the world that are distorted by idiosyncratic experiences not applicable to their current social situation. A system of construction that chronically fails to characterize and/or predict events, and is not appropriately revised to comprehend and predict one's changing social world, is considered to underlie psychopathology (mental disorders.)

The field of abnormal psychology identifies multiple causes for different conditions, employing diverse theories from the general field of psychology and elsewhere, and much still hinges on what exactly is meant by \"abnormal\". There has traditionally been a divide between psychological and biological explanations, reflecting a philosophical dualism in regard to the mind–body problem . There have also been different approaches in trying to classify mental disorders . Abnormal includes three different categories; they are subnormal , supernormal and paranormal . [ 3 ] The science of abnormal psychology studies two types of behaviors: adaptive and maladaptive behaviors . Behaviors that are maladaptive suggest that some problem(s) exist, and can also imply that the individual is vulnerable and cannot cope with environmental stress, which is leading them to have problems functioning in daily life in their emotions, mental thinking, physical actions and talks.

Psychopathology is a similar term to abnormal psychology, but may have more of an implication of an underlying pathology (disease process), which assumes the medical model of mental disturbance and as such, is a term more commonly used in the medical specialty known as psychiatry . [ 5 ] Hippocrates (460–377 BCE) hypothesized that the body and mind become unwell when the so-called humors , vital fluids in the body, become unbalanced. The four temperaments theory posits four such humors: black bile, yellow bile, phlegm, and blood. Each humor was associated with a particular temperament: too much phlegm causes a person to be fatigued, too much black bile causes melancholia , yellow bile causes a quick temper, and too much blood causes optimism, cheerfulness, and confidence.

However, many of the patients received helpful medical treatment. There was scientific curiosity into abnormal behavior, although it was rarely investigated in the early asylums. Inmates in these early asylums were often put on display for profit, as they were viewed as less than human. The early asylums were basically modifications of the existing criminal institutions. [ 8 ] In the late 18th century, the idea of humanitarian treatment for the patients gained much favor, due to the work of Philippe Pinel in France. He pushed for the idea that the patients should be treated with kindness, and not the cruelty inflicted on them, as if they were animals or criminals. His experimental ideas, such as removing the chains from the patients, were met with reluctance. The experiments in kindness proved to be a great success, which helped to bring about a reform in the way mental institutions would be run. [ 8 ] Institutionalization would continue to improve throughout the 19th and 20th century, as a result of the work of many humanitarians such as Dorothea Dix , and the mental hygiene movement which promoted the physical well-being of the mental patients. \"Dix, more than any other figure in the nineteenth century, made people in America and virtually all of Europe aware that the insane were being subjected to incredible abuses.\" [ 9 ] Through this movement, millions of dollars were raised to build new institutions to house the mentally ill.

Mental hospitals began to grow substantially in numbers during the 20th century, as care for the mentally ill increased in them. By 1939, there were over 400,000 patients in state mental hospitals in the US. [ 10 ] Hospital stays were normally quite long for the patients, with some individuals being treated for many years. These hospitals, while better than the asylums of the past, were still lacking in the means of effective treatment for the patients. Even though the reform movement had occurred, patients were often still met with cruel and inhumane treatment. Things began to change in the year 1946, when Mary Jane Ward published the influential novel titled The Snake Pit , which was made into a popular movie of the same name . The book called attention to the conditions which mental patients faced, and helped to spark concern in the general public to create more humane mental health care in these overcrowded hospitals. [ 10 ] That same year, the National Institute of Mental Health was also created, which provided support for the training of hospital employees, and research into the conditions of the patients. During this period, the Hill-Burton Acts was also passed, which was a program that funded mental health hospitals. Along with the Community Health Services Act of 1963, the Hill-Burton Acts helped with the creation of outpatient psychiatric clinics, inpatient general hospitals, and rehabilitation and community consultation centers.

Kennedy launched the community health movement in the United States as a \"bold new approach\" to mental health care, aimed at coordinating mental health services for citizens in mental health centers. In the span of 40 years, the United States was able to see an about 90 percent drop in the number of patients in psychiatric hospitals. [ 7 ] Deinstitutionalisation ended the long-term confinement of patients in isolating mental hospitals, which could and did cause long-term negative adaptations. For instance, institutionalizing people with schizophrenia worsens negative symptoms . [ 11 ] However, the practice is sometimes criticised for a perceived rise in homelessness amongst people who were previously institutionalized, or are presumed that they would have been in the institution era. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] People have tried to explain and control abnormal behavior for thousands of years. Historically, there have been three main approaches to abnormal behavior: the supernatural , biological , and psychological traditions. [ 2 ] : 7 Abnormal psychology revolves around two major paradigms for explaining mental disorders, the psychological paradigm and the biological paradigm. The psychological paradigm focuses more on the humanistic, cognitive, and behavioral causes and effects of psychopathology.

In the first supernatural tradition, also called the demonological method, abnormal behaviors are attributed to agents outside human bodies. According to this model, abnormal behaviors are caused by demons , aliens , or spirits, or the influences of the Moon , planets, and stars. During the Stone Age, trepanning was performed on those who had mental illness , to literally cut the evil spirits out of the victim's head. Conversely, Ancient Chinese , Ancient Egyptians , and Hebrews believed that these were evil demons or spirits and advocated exorcism . By the time of the Greeks and Romans , mental illnesses were thought to be caused by an imbalance of the four humors which lead treatments like the draining of fluids from the brain . During the Medieval period, many Europeans believed that the power of witches , demons, and spirits caused abnormal behaviors. People with psychological disorders were thought to be possessed by evil spirits that had to be exorcised through religious rituals. If exorcism failed, some authorities advocated steps such as confinement, beating, and other types of torture to make the body uninhabitable to witches, demons, and spirits. The belief that witches, demons, and spirits are responsible for the abnormal behavior continued into the 15th century.

[ 2 ] : 11 This tradition is still alive today. Some people, especially in the developing countries, as well as some followers of religious sects in the developed countries, continue to believe that supernatural powers influence human behaviors. In Western academia, the supernatural tradition has been largely replaced by the biological and psychological traditions. [ 2 ] : 26 Throughout time, societies have proposed several explanations of abnormal behavior within human beings. Beginning in some hunter-gatherer societies, animists have believed that people demonstrating abnormal behavior are possessed by malevolent spirits . This idea has been associated with trepanation , the practice of cutting a hole into the individual's skull in order to release the malevolent spirits. [ 14 ] Although it has been difficult to define abnormal psychology, one definition includes characteristics such as statistical infrequency. [ 15 ] A more formalized response to spiritual beliefs about abnormality is the practice of exorcism. Performed by religious authorities, exorcism is thought of as another way to release evil spirits who cause pathological behavior within the person. In some instances, individuals exhibiting unusual thoughts or behaviors have been exiled from society, or worse. Perceived witchcraft, for example, has been punished by death. Two Catholic Inquisitors wrote the Malleus Maleficarum (Latin for \"The Hammer Against Witches\"), which was used by many Inquisitors and witch-hunters.

In the psychological tradition, disorders are attributed to faulty psychological development , and to social context . [ 2 ] : 26 The medical or biological perspective holds the belief that most or all abnormal behavior can be attributed to a medical factor; assuming all psychological disorders are diseases. [ 17 ] The Greek physician Hippocrates , who is considered to be the father of Western medicine, played a major role in the biological tradition. Hippocrates and his associates wrote the Hippocratic Corpus between 450 and 350 BC, in which they suggested that abnormal behaviors can be treated like any other disease. Hippocrates viewed the brain as the seat of consciousness , emotion , intelligence , and wisdom and believed that disorders involving these functions would logically be located in the brain. [ 2 ] : 11 These ideas of Hippocrates and his associates were later adopted by Galen , the Roman physician. Galen extended these ideas and developed a strong and influential school of thought within the biological tradition that extended well into the 18th century. Kendra Cherry, MSEd, states: \"The medical approach to abnormal psychology focuses on the biological causes of mental illness. This perspective emphasizes understanding the underlying cause of disorders, which might include genetic inheritance, related physical disorders, infections, and chemical imbalances.

The super-ego represents a person's conscience and their internalization of societal norms and morality. Finally, the ego serves to realistically integrate the drives of the id with the prohibitions of the super-ego. Lack of development in the Superego, or an incoherently developed Superego within an individual, will result in thoughts and actions that are irrational and abnormal, contrary to the norms and beliefs of society. [ 19 ] Irrational beliefs are driven by unconscious fears and can result in abnormal behavior. [ 20 ] Rational emotive behavior therapy helps to drive irrational and maladaptive beliefs out of one's mind. [ 20 ] The term sociocultural refers to the various circles of influence on the individual, ranging from close friends and family, to the institutions and policies of a country, or the world as a whole. Discriminations, whether based on social class, income, race and ethnicity, or gender, can influence the development of abnormal behaviour.

The attempt to explain all mental disorders with the same theory leads to reductionism (explaining a disorder or other complex phenomena using only a single idea or perspective). [ 22 ] Most mental disorders are composed of several factors, which is why one must take into account several theoretical perspectives, when attempting to diagnose or explain a particular behavioral abnormality or mental disorder. Explaining mental disorders with a combination of theoretical perspectives is known as multiple causality. The diathesis–stress model [ 23 ] emphasizes the importance of applying multiple causality to psychopathology, by stressing that disorders are caused by both precipitating causes, and predisposing causes. A precipitating cause is an immediate trigger that instigates a person's action or behavior. A predisposing cause is an underlying factor that interacts with the immediate factors to result in a disorder. Both causes play a key role in the development of a psychological disorder. [ 22 ] For example, high neuroticism antedates most types of psychopathology. [ 24 ] There is a wide range of mental disorders that are considered to be forms of Abnormal Psychology. These include, but are not limited to: Schizophrenia can be described as a disorder that causes extreme loss of touch with reality. The Psychotic nature of schizophrenia manifests itself through delusions , as well as auditory and visual hallucinations .

[ 28 ] Additional traits may include superficial charm, sexual promiscuity, and pathological lying. [ 28 ] Dissociative identity disorder (DID) involves one individual having multiple personalities. Those with DID are described as having multiple selves that each have their own consciousness and awareness. [ 29 ] DID has two main etiologies, which are the post-traumatic and socio-cognitive models. [ 29 ] The post-traumatic model states that DID is caused by inescapable past trauma, such as child abuse. The child dissociates and forms alternate personalities as a coping mechanism, in response to the current trauma. Even when the trauma ends, the personalities continue to disrupt the person's life longterm. The socio-cognitive model states that people will implicitly act as if they have multiple personalities and that it is done to align with cultural norms.

The field is generally considered to have begun in 1896 with the opening of the first psychological clinic at the University of Pennsylvania by Lightner Witmer . In the first half of the 20th century, clinical psychology was focused on psychological assessment, with little attention given to treatment. This changed after the 1940s when World War II resulted in the need for a large increase in the number of trained clinicians. Since that time, three main educational models have developed in the US—the PhD Clinical Science model (heavily focused on research), [ 4 ] the PhD science-practitioner model (integrating scientific research and practice), and the PsyD practitioner-scholar model (focusing on clinical theory and practice). In the UK and Ireland, the Clinical Psychology Doctorate falls between the latter two of these models, whilst in much of mainland Europe, the training is at the master's level and predominantly psychotherapeutic.

Currently, only seven US states ( Louisiana , New Mexico , Illinois , Iowa , Idaho , Colorado and, most recently, Utah ) allow clinical psychologists with advanced specialty training to prescribe psychotropic medications . Psychiatrists are medical doctors who specialize in the treatment of mental disorders via a variety of methods, including diagnostic assessment, psychotherapy, psychoactive medications, and medical procedures such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Psychiatrists do not as standard have advanced training in psychometrics or psychotherapy equivalent to that of Clinical Psychologists. The earliest recorded approaches to assess and treat mental distress were a combination of religious, magical, or medical perspectives. [ 5 ] In the early 19th century, one approach to study mental conditions and behavior was using phrenology , the study of personality by examining the shape of the skull. Other popular treatments at that time included the study of the shape of the face ( physiognomy ) and Mesmer 's treatment for mental conditions using magnets ( mesmerism ). Spiritualism and Phineas Quimby 's \"mental healing\" were also popular.

By the second half of the 1800s, the scientific study of psychology was becoming well established in university laboratories. Although there were a few scattered voices calling for applied psychology, the general field looked down upon this idea and insisted on \"pure\" science as the only respectable practice.

[ 12 ] At the same time, female psychologists (who were excluded from the war effort) formed the National Council of Women Psychologists with the purpose of helping communities deal with the stresses of war and giving young mothers advice on child rearing.

The concept of a practice-oriented degree was debated in 1965 and narrowly gained approval for a pilot program at the University of Illinois starting in 1968.

Some teach, whether in a medical school or hospital setting, or in an academic department (e.g., psychology department) at an institution of higher education . The majority of clinical psychologists engage in some form of clinical practice, with professional services including psychological assessment, provision of psychotherapy, development and administration of clinical programs, and forensics (e.g., providing expert testimony in a legal proceeding ). [ 8 ] In clinical practice, clinical psychologists may work with individuals, couples, families, or groups in a variety of settings, including private practices, hospitals, mental health organizations, schools, businesses, and non-profit agencies. Clinical psychologists who provide clinical services may also choose to specialize. Some specializations are codified and credentialed by regulatory agencies within the country of practice.

[ 21 ] The practice of clinical psychology requires a license in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and many other countries. In the US, about half of all clinical psychology graduate students are being trained in PhD programs—a model that emphasizes research—with the other half in PsyD programs, which has more focus on practice (similar to professional degrees for medicine and law). [ 17 ] Both models are accredited by the American Psychological Association [ 22 ] and many other English-speaking psychological societies. A smaller number of schools offer accredited programs in clinical psychology resulting in a master's degree , which usually takes two to three years post-Bachelors. Although each of the US states is somewhat different in terms of requirements and licenses, there are three common elements: [ 23 ] All U.S. state and Canadian province licensing boards are members of the Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards (ASPPB), which created and maintains the Examination for Professional Practice in Psychology (EPPP).

[ 24 ] In the UK, clinical psychologists undertake a Doctor of Clinical Psychology (DClinPsych), which is a practitioner doctorate with both clinical and research components. This is a three-year full-time salaried program sponsored by the National Health Service (NHS) and based in universities and the NHS. Entry into these programs is highly competitive and requires at least a three-year undergraduate degree in psychology plus some form of experience, usually in either the NHS as an assistant psychologist or in academia as a research assistant. It is not unusual for applicants to apply several times before being accepted onto a training course as only about one-fifth of applicants are accepted each year. [ 25 ] These clinical psychology doctoral degrees are accredited by the British Psychological Society and the Health Professions Council ( HPC ).

An important area of expertise for many clinical psychologists is psychological assessment , and there are indications that as many as 91% of psychologists engage in this core clinical practice. [ 37 ] Such evaluation is usually done in service to gaining insight into and forming hypotheses about psychological or behavioral problems. As such, the results of such assessments are usually used to create generalized impressions (rather than diagnoses ) in service to informing treatment planning. Methods include formal testing measures, interviews, reviewing records, clinical observation, and physical examination. [ 2 ] There exist hundreds of various assessment tools, although only a few have been shown to have both high validity (i.e., test actually measures what it claims to measure) and reliability (i.e., consistency).

It is also concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of behavioral and cognitive effects of neurological disorders . Whereas classical neurology focuses on the pathology of the nervous system and classical psychology is largely divorced from it, neuropsychology seeks to discover how the brain correlates with the mind through the study of neurological patients. It thus shares concepts and concerns with neuropsychiatry and with behavioral neurology in general. The term neuropsychology has been applied to lesion studies in humans and animals. It has also been applied in efforts to record electrical activity from individual cells (or groups of cells) in higher primates (including some studies of human patients). [ 2 ] In practice, neuropsychologists tend to work in research settings ( universities , laboratories , or research institutions), clinical settings (medical hospitals or rehabilitation settings, often involved in assessing or treating patients with neuropsychological problems), and forensic settings or industry (often as clinical-trial consultants where CNS function is a concern).

For many centuries, the brain was thought useless and was often discarded during burial processes and autopsies. As the field of medicine developed its understanding of human anatomy and physiology , different theories were developed as to why the body functioned the way it did. Many times, bodily functions were approached from a religious point of view, and abnormalities were blamed on bad spirits and the gods. The brain has not always been considered the center of the functioning body. It has taken hundreds of years to develop our understanding of the brain and how it affects our behaviors. In ancient Egypt, writings on medicine date from the time of the priest Imhotep . [ 5 ] They took a more scientific approach to medicine and disease, describing the brain, trauma, abnormalities, and remedies for reference for future physicians. Despite this, Egyptians saw the heart, not the brain, as the seat of the soul . [ 6 ] Aristotle reinforced this focus on the heart which originated in Egypt. He believed the heart to be in control of mental processes, and looked on the brain, due to its inert nature, as a mechanism for cooling the heat generated by the heart.

[ 9 ] The influence of Aristotle in the development of neuropsychology is evident within language used in modern day, since we \"follow our hearts\" and \"learn by the heart.\" [ 9 ] Hippocrates viewed the brain as the seat of the soul. He drew a connection between the brain and behaviors of the body, writing: \"The brain exercises the greatest power in the man.\" [ 10 ] Apart from moving the focus from the heart as the \"seat of the soul\" to the brain, Hippocrates did not go into much detail about its actual functioning. However, by switching the attention of the medical community to the brain, his theory led to more scientific discovery of the organ responsible for our behaviors. For years to come, scientists were inspired to explore the functions of the body and to find concrete explanations for both normal and abnormal behaviors. Scientific discovery led them to believe that there were natural and organically occurring reasons to explain various functions of the body, and it could all be traced back to the brain.

Often Descartes's ideas were looked upon as overly philosophical and lacking in sufficient scientific foundation. Descartes focused much of his anatomical experimentation on the brain, paying special attention to the pineal gland – which he argued was the actual \"seat of the soul.\" Still deeply rooted in a spiritual outlook towards the scientific world, the body was said to be mortal, and the soul immortal. The pineal gland was then thought to be the very place at which the mind would interact with the mortal and machine-like body. At the time, Descartes was convinced the mind had control over the behaviors of the body (controlling the person) – but also that the body could have influence over the mind, which is referred to as dualism . [ 11 ] This idea that the mind essentially had control over the body, but the body could resist or even influence other behaviors, was a major turning point in the way many physiologists would look at the brain. The capabilities of the mind were observed to do much more than simply react, but also to be rational and function in organized, thoughtful ways – much more complex than he thought the animal world to be.

The mind–body problem, spurred by René Descartes, continues to this day with many philosophical arguments both for and against his ideas. However controversial they were and remain today, the fresh and well-thought-out perspective Descartes presented has had long-lasting effects on the various disciplines of medicine, psychology, and much more, especially in putting an emphasis on separating the mind from the body in order to explain observable behaviors. It was in the mid-17th century that another major contributor to the field of neuropsychology emerged. Thomas Willis studied at Oxford University and took a physiological approach to the brain and behavior. It was Willis who coined the words 'hemisphere' and 'lobe' when referring to the brain. [ 12 ] He was one of the earliest to use the words 'neurology' and 'psychology'. Rejecting the idea that humans were the only beings capable of rational thought, Willis looked at specialized structures of the brain. [ 9 ] He theorized that higher structures accounted for complex functions, whereas lower structures were responsible for functions similar to those seen in other animals, consisting mostly of reactions and automatic responses.

Through his in-depth study of the brain and behavior, Willis concluded that automated responses such as breathing, heartbeats, and other various motor activities were carried out within the lower region of the brain. Although much of his work has been made obsolete, his ideas presented the brain as more complex than previously imagined, and led the way for future pioneers to understand and build upon his theories, especially when it came to looking at disorders and dysfunctions in the brain. [ 14 ] Neuroanatomist and physiologist Franz Joseph Gall made major progress in understanding the brain. He theorized that personality was directly related to features and structures within the brain. However, Gall's major contribution within the field of neuroscience is his invention of phrenology . This new discipline looked at the brain as an organ of the mind, where the shape of the skull could ultimately determine one's intelligence and personality. [ 16 ] This theory was like many circulating at the time, as many scientists were taking into account physical features of the face and body, head size, anatomical structure, and levels of intelligence; only Gall looked primarily at the brain. There was much debate over the validity of Gall's claims however, because he was often found to be wrong in his predictions.

[ 17 ] As controversial and false as many of Gall's claims were, his contributions to understanding cortical regions of the brain and localized activity continued to advance understanding of the brain, personality, and behavior. His work is considered crucial to having laid a firm foundation in the field of neuropsychology, which would flourish over the next few decades. Towards the late 19th century, the belief that the size of ones skull could determine their level of intelligence was discarded as science and medicine moved forward. A physician by the name of Jean-Baptiste Bouillaud expanded upon the ideas of Gall and took a closer look at the idea of distinct cortical regions of the brain each having their own independent function. Bouillaud was specifically interested in speech and wrote many publications on the anterior region of the brain being responsible for carrying out the act of ones speech, a discovery that had stemmed from the research of Gall. He was also one of the first to use larger samples for research although it took many years for that method to be accepted. By looking at over a hundred different case studies, Bouillaud came to discover that it was through different areas of the brain that speech is completed and understood. By observing people with brain damage, his theory was made more concrete.

There are many arguable debates as to who deserves the most credit for such discoveries, [ 18 ] and often, people remain unmentioned, but Paul Broca is perhaps one of the most famous and well known contributors to neuropsychology – often referred to as \"the father\" of the discipline. Inspired by the advances being made in the area of localized function within the brain, Paul Broca committed much of his study to the phenomena of how speech is understood and produced. Through his study, it was discovered and expanded upon that we articulate via the left hemisphere. Broca's observations and methods are widely considered to be where neuropsychology really takes form as a recognizable and respected discipline. Armed with the understanding that specific, independent areas of the brain are responsible for articulation and understanding of speech, the brains abilities were finally being acknowledged as the complex and highly intricate organ that it is. Broca was essentially the first to fully break away from the ideas of phrenology and delve deeper into a more scientific and psychological view of the brain. [ 19 ] Carl Wernicke was an influential nineteenth century neuropsychiatrist specifically interested in understanding how abnormalities could be localized to specific brain regions.

Post-morbid analysis revealed a lesion near the auditory region of the brain in the parietal-temporal region of the left hemisphere. [ 21 ] Originally named sensory aphasia, this region later became known as Wernicke's area. [ 21 ] Individuals with damage to this area present with fluent but receptive aphasia characterized by the inability to comprehend or express written or spoken language while maintaining intact speech and auditory processes. [ 22 ] Along with Paul Broca, Wernicke's contributions greatly expanded the present knowledge of language development and localization of left hemispheric function. In 1909, German anatomist and neuropsychiatrist, Professor Korbinian Brodmann published his original research on brain mapping, defining 52 distinct regions of the cerebral cortex, known as Brodmann areas now. [ 23 ] In contemporary science, the regions that Brodmann identified are frequently referred to by their function, rather than by the number Brodmann assigned to them. These areas are still widely used in brain research, neuroimaging, and clinical diagnosis today.

Through his research with the rats, he learned that forgetting was dependent on the amount of tissue removed and not where it was removed from. He called this mass action and he believed that it was a general rule that governed how brain tissue would respond, independent of the type of learning. But we know now that mass action was a misinterpretation of his empirical results, because in order to run a maze the rats required multiple cortical areas. Cutting into small individual parts alone will not impair the rats' brains much, but taking large sections removes multiple cortical areas at one time, affecting various functions such as sight, motor coordination, and memory, making the animal unable to run a maze properly. [ 26 ] Neurosurgeon Karl Pribram worked with Lashley to determine the exact location of specific memories in primate brains. [ 27 ] This work would influence the establishment of Pribram's Holonomic brain theory . Lashley also proposed that a portion of a functional area could carry out the role of the entire area, even when the rest of the area has been removed. He called this phenomenon equipotentiality .

Experimental neuropsychology is an approach that uses methods from experimental psychology to uncover the relationship between the nervous system and cognitive function. The majority of work involves studying healthy humans in a laboratory setting, although a minority of researchers may conduct animal experiments. Human work in this area often takes advantage of specific features of our nervous system (for example that visual information presented to a specific visual field is preferentially processed by the cortical hemisphere on the opposite side) to make links between neuroanatomy and psychological function. [ 28 ] Clinical neuropsychology is the application of neuropsychological knowledge to the assessment (see neuropsychological test and neuropsychological assessment ), management, and rehabilitation of people who have experienced illness or injury (particularly to the brain) which has caused neurocognitive problems. In particular they bring a psychological viewpoint to treatment, to understand how such illness and injury may affect and be affected by psychological factors. [ 29 ] They also can offer an opinion as to whether a person is demonstrating difficulties due to brain pathology or as a consequence of an emotional or another (potentially) reversible cause or both. For example, a test might show that both patients X and Y are unable to name items that they have been previously exposed to within the past 20 minutes (indicating possible dementia).

If patient Y can name some of them with further prompting (e.g. given a categorical clue such as being told that the item they could not name is a fruit), this allows a more specific diagnosis than simply dementia (Y appears to have the vascular type which is due to brain pathology but is usually at least somewhat reversible). Clinical neuropsychologists often work in hospital settings in an interdisciplinary medical team; others work in private practice and may provide expert input into medico-legal proceedings. [ 30 ] Current research into biological science of memory bridges multiple scales, from the molecular to the neuropsychological (Moscovitch et al., 2016). Memory needs specific details on the specifics of synaptic dynamism and also requires an explanation of the comprehension procedures and memory structures having neurobiological capabilities. Cognitive neuropsychology is a relatively new development and has emerged as a distillation of the complementary approaches of both experimental and clinical neuropsychology. It seeks to understand the mind and brain by studying people with brain injuries or neurological illnesses. One model of neuropsychological functioning is known as functional localization. [ 31 ] This is based on the principle that if a specific cognitive problem can be found after an injury to a specific area of the brain, it is possible that this part of the brain is in some way involved. However, there may be reason to believe that the link between mental functions and neural regions is not so simple. An alternative model of the link between mind and brain, such as parallel processing , may have more explanatory power for the workings and dysfunction of the human brain."

Yet another approach investigates how the pattern of errors produced by brain-damaged individuals can constrain our understanding of mental representations and processes without reference to the underlying neural structure. A more recent but related approach is cognitive neuropsychiatry which seeks to understand the normal function of mind and brain by studying psychiatric or mental illness . [ 32 ] Connectionism is the use of artificial neural networks to model specific cognitive processes using what are considered to be simplified but plausible models of how neurons operate. Once trained to perform a specific cognitive task these networks are often damaged or 'lesioned' to simulate brain injury or impairment in an attempt to understand and compare the results to the effects of brain injury in humans. [ 33 ] Functional neuroimaging uses specific neuroimaging technologies to take readings from the brain, usually when a person is doing a particular task, in an attempt to understand how the activation of particular brain areas is related to the task. In particular, the growth of methodologies to employ cognitive testing within established functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) techniques to study brain-behavi"

Psychotherapy aims to improve an individual's well-being and mental health , to resolve or mitigate troublesome behaviors, beliefs, compulsions, thoughts, or emotions, and to improve relationships and social skills . [ 1 ] Numerous types of psychotherapy have been designed either for individual adults, families, or children and adolescents. Some types of psychotherapy are considered evidence-based for treating diagnosed mental disorders ; other types have been criticized as pseudoscience . [ 2 ] There are hundreds of psychotherapy techniques, some being minor variations; others are based on very different conceptions of psychology. [ 3 ] Most approaches involve one-to-one sessions, between the client and therapist, but some are conducted with groups , [ 4 ] including couples and families . Psychotherapists may be mental health professionals such as psychiatrists , psychologists , mental health nurses , clinical social workers , marriage and family therapists , or licensed professional counselors . Psychotherapists may also come from a variety of other backgrounds, and depending on the jurisdiction may be legally regulated, voluntarily regulated or unregulated (and the term itself may be protected or not).

Challenges include high dropout rates, limited understanding of mechanisms of change, potential adverse effects , and concerns about therapist adherence to treatment fidelity. Critics have raised questions about psychotherapy's scientific basis , cultural assumptions , and power dynamics , while others argue it is underutilized compared to pharmacological treatments . The term psychotherapy is derived from Ancient Greek psyche ( ψυχή meaning \"breath; spirit; soul\") and therapeia ( θεραπεία \"healing; medical treatment\"). The Oxford English Dictionary defines it as \"The treatment of disorders of the mind or personality by psychological means...\", however, in earlier use, it denoted the treatment of disease through hypnotic suggestion. [ 6 ] [ citation needed ] Psychotherapy is often dubbed as a \"talking therapy\" or \"talk therapy\", particularly for a general audience, [ 7 ] though not all forms of psychotherapy rely on verbal communication . [ 8 ] Children or adults who do not engage in verbal communication (or not in the usual way) are not excluded from psychotherapy; indeed some types are designed for such cases.

[ 9 ] Influential editions of a work by psychiatrist Jerome Frank defined psychotherapy as a healing relationship using socially authorized methods in a series of contacts primarily involving words, acts and rituals—which Frank regarded as forms of persuasion and rhetoric . [ 10 ] Historically, psychotherapy has sometimes meant \"interpretative\" (i.e. Freudian ) methods, namely psychoanalysis , in contrast with other methods to treat psychiatric disorders such as behavior modification. [ 11 ] Some definitions of counseling overlap with psychotherapy (particularly in non-directive client-centered approaches), or counseling may refer to guidance for everyday problems in specific areas, typically for shorter durations with a less medical or \"professional\" focus. [ 12 ] Somatotherapy refers to the use of physical changes as injuries and illnesses, and sociotherapy to the use of a person's social environment to effect therapeutic change. [ 13 ] Psychotherapy may address spirituality as a significant part of someone's mental / psychological life, and some forms are derived from spiritual philosophies, but practices based on treating the spiritual as a separate dimension are not necessarily considered as traditional or 'legitimate' forms of psychotherapy.

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] Most forms of psychotherapy use spoken conversation . Some also use various other forms of communication such as the written word, artwork , drama , narrative story or music. Psychotherapy with children and their parents often involves play , dramatization (i.e. role-play), and drawing, with a co-constructed narrative from these non-verbal and displaced modes of interacting.

[ 22 ] Clinical psychologists have specialist doctoral degrees in psychology with some clinical and research components. Other clinical practitioners, social workers , mental health counselors, pastoral counselors, and nurses with a specialization in mental health, also often conduct psychotherapy. Many of the wide variety of psychotherapy training programs and institutional settings are multi-professional. In most countries, psychotherapy training is completed at a postgraduate level, often at a master's degree (or doctoral) level, over four years, with significant clinical supervision and clinical placements. Mental health professionals that choose to specialize in psychotherapeutic work also require a program of continuing professional education after basic professional training. [ 23 ] A listing of the extensive professional competencies of a European psychotherapist was developed by the European Association of Psychotherapy (EAP) in 2013. [ 24 ] As sensitive and deeply personal topics are often discussed during psychotherapy, therapists are expected, and usually legally bound, to respect client or patient confidentiality. The critical importance of client confidentiality —and the limited circumstances in which it may need to be broken for the protection of clients or others—is enshrined in the regulatory psychotherapeutic organizations' codes of ethical practice.

[ 26 ] As of 2015, there are still a lot of variations between different European countries about the regulation and delivery of psychotherapy. Several countries have no regulation of the practice or no protection of the title. Some have a system of voluntary registration, with independent professional organizations, while other countries attempt to restrict the practice of psychotherapy to 'mental health professionals' (psychologists and psychiatrists) with state-certified training. The titles that are protected also vary. [ 27 ] The European Association for Psychotherapy (EAP) established the 1990 Strasbourg Declaration on Psychotherapy, which is dedicated to establishing an independent profession of psychotherapy in Europe, with pan-European standards. [ 28 ] The EAP has already made significant contacts with the European Union & European Commission towards this end. Given that the European Union has a primary policy about the free movement of labor within Europe, European legislation can overrule national regulations that are, in essence, forms of restrictive practices. In Germany, the practice of psychotherapy for adults is restricted to qualified psychologists and physicians (including psychiatrists) who have completed several years of specialist practical training and certification in psychotherapy. [ 29 ] As psychoanalysis, psychodynamic therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and systemic therapy meet the requirements of German health insurance companies, mental health professionals regularly opt for one of these four specializations in their postgraduate training.

[ 30 ] Social workers may complete the specialist training for child and teenage clients. [ 31 ] Similarly in Italy, the practice of psychotherapy is restricted to graduates in psychology or medicine who have completed four years of recognised specialist training. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] Sweden has a similar restriction on the title \"psychotherapist\", which may only be used by professionals who have gone through a post-graduate training in psychotherapy and then applied for a licence, issued by the National Board of Health and Welfare .

In some states, counselors or therapists must be licensed to use certain words and titles on self-identification or advertising. In some other states, the restrictions on practice are more closely associated with the charging of fees. Licensing and regulation are performed by various states. Presentation of practice as licensed, but without such a license, is generally illegal. [ 43 ] Without a license, for example, a practitioner cannot bill insurance companies. [ 44 ] Information about state licensure of psychologists is provided by the American Psychological Association . [ 45 ] In addition to state laws, the American Psychological Association requires its members to adhere to its published Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct .

Some other professionals who were practising psychotherapy before the current system came into force continue to hold psychotherapy permits alone. [ 48 ] On 1 July 2019, Ontario's Missing Persons Act came into effect, with the purpose of giving police more power to investigate missing persons. It allows police to require (as opposed to permit) health professionals, including psychotherapists, to share otherwise confidential documents about their client, if there is reason to believe their client is missing.

[ 55 ] [ 56 ] In the Western tradition , by the 19th century, a moral treatment movement (then meaning morale or mental) developed based on non-invasive non-restraint therapeutic methods. [ 57 ] Another influential movement was started by Franz Mesmer (1734–1815) and his student Armand-Marie-Jacques de Chastenet, Marquis of Puységur (1751–1825). Called Mesmerism or animal magnetism, it would have a strong influence on the rise of dynamic psychology and psychiatry as well as theories about hypnosis . [ 58 ] [ 59 ] In 1853, Walter Cooper Dendy introduced the term \"psycho-therapeia\" regarding how physicians might influence the mental states of patients and thus their bodily ailments, for example by creating opposing emotions to promote mental balance. [ 60 ] [ 61 ] Daniel Hack Tuke cited the term and wrote about \"psycho-therapeutics\" in 1872 in his book Illustrations of the Influence of the Mind upon the Body in Health and Disease , in which he also proposed making a science of animal magnetism .

[ 62 ] [ 64 ] Also in 1889 a clinic used the word in its title for the first time, when Frederik van Eeden and Albert Willem van Renterghem in Amsterdam renamed theirs \"Clinique de Psycho-thérapeutique Suggestive\" after visiting Nancy. [ 62 ] During this time, travelling stage hypnosis became popular, and such activities added to the scientific controversies around the use of hypnosis in medicine. [ 62 ] Also in 1892, at the second congress of experimental psychology, van Eeden attempted to take the credit for the term psychotherapy and to distance the term from hypnosis. [ 62 ] In 1896, the German journal Zeitschrift für Hypnotismus, Suggestionstherapie, Suggestionslehre und verwandte psychologische Forschungen changed its name to Zeitschrift für Hypnotismus, Psychotherapie sowie andere psychophysiologische und psychopathologische Forschungen, which is probably the first journal to use the term. [ 62 ] Thus psychotherapy initially meant \"the treatment of disease by psychic or hypnotic influence, or by suggestion\". [ 6 ] Sigmund Freud visited the Nancy School and his early neurological practice involved the use of hypnotism. However following the work of his mentor Josef Breuer —in particular a case where symptoms appeared partially resolved by what the patient, Bertha Pappenheim , dubbed a \" talking cure \"—Freud began focusing on conditions that appeared to have psychological causes originating in childhood experiences and the unconscious mind .

His popular reputation as the father of psychotherapy was established by his use of the distinct term \" psychoanalysis \", tied to an overarching system of theories and methods, and by the effective work of his followers in rewriting history. [ 62 ] Many theorists, including Alfred Adler , Carl Jung , Karen Horney , Anna Freud , Otto Rank , Erik Erikson , Melanie Klein and Heinz Kohut , built upon Freud's fundamental ideas and often developed their own systems of psychotherapy. These were all later categorized as psychodynamic , meaning anything that involved the psyche 's conscious / unconscious influence on external relationships and the self. Sessions tended to number into the hundreds over several years. Behaviorism developed in the 1920s, and behavior modification as a therapy became popularized in the 1950s and 1960s. Notable contributors were Joseph Wolpe in South Africa, M.B. Shapiro and Hans Eysenck [ 65 ] in Britain, and John B. Watson and B.F. Skinner in the United States.

This therapy focuses on challenging unhelpful and irrational negative thoughts and beliefs, referred to as \"self-talk\" and replacing them with more rational positive self-talk. This alteration in a person's thinking produces less anxiety and depression. It was developed by psychoanalyst Aaron Beck in the 1950s. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on challenging and changing cognitive distortions (thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes) and their associated behaviors in order to improve emotional regulation and help the individual develop coping strategies to address problems. [ 2 ] [ 4 ] Though originally designed as an approach to treat depression , CBT is often prescribed for the evidence-informed treatment of many mental health and other conditions, including obsessive–compulsive disorder , [ 5 ] generalized anxiety disorder , [ 6 ] substance use disorders , marital problems, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , and eating disorders .

Precursors of certain fundamental aspects of CBT have been identified in various ancient philosophical traditions, particularly Stoicism . [ 25 ] Aaron T. Beck 's original treatment manual for depression states, \"The philosophical origins of cognitive therapy can be traced back to the Stoic philosophers\". [ 26 ] Another example of Stoic influence on cognitive theorists is the influence of Epictetus on Albert Ellis .

[ 31 ] The modern roots of CBT can be traced to the development of behavior therapy in the early 20th century, the development of cognitive therapy in the 1960s, and the subsequent merging of the two.

[ 35 ] These were the antecedents of the development of Joseph Wolpe 's behavioral therapy in the 1950s. [ 33 ] It was the work of Wolpe and Watson, which was based on Ivan Pavlov 's work on learning and conditioning, that influenced Hans Eysenck and Arnold Lazarus to develop new behavioral therapy techniques based on classical conditioning. [ 33 ] [ 36 ] During the 1950s and 1960s, behavioral therapy became widely used by researchers in the United States, the United Kingdom, and South Africa. Their inspiration was by the behaviorist learning theory of Ivan Pavlov, John B. Watson, and Clark L. Hull . [ 34 ] In Britain, Joseph Wolpe, who applied the findings of animal experiments to his method of systematic desensitization , [ 33 ] applied behavioral research to the treatment of neurotic disorders. Wolpe's therapeutic efforts were precursors to today's fear reduction techniques. [ 34 ] British psychologist Hans Eysenck presented behavior therapy as a constructive alternative. [ 34 ] [ 37 ] At the same time as Eysenck's work, B. F. Skinner and his associates were beginning to have an impact with their work on operant conditioning . [ 33 ] [ 36 ] Skinner's work was referred to as radical behaviorism and avoided anything related to cognition.

[ 38 ] The emphasis on behavioral factors has been described as the \"first wave\" of CBT. [ 39 ] One of the first therapists to address cognition in psychotherapy was Alfred Adler , notably with his idea of basic mistakes and how they contributed to creation of unhealthy behavioral and life goals. [ 40 ] Abraham Low believed that someone's thoughts were best changed by changing their actions. [ 41 ] Adler and Low influenced the work of Albert Ellis, [ 40 ] [ 42 ] who developed the earliest cognitive-based psychotherapy called rational emotive behavioral therapy , or REBT. [ 43 ] The first version of REBT was announced to the public in 1956. [ 44 ] In the late 1950s, Aaron Beck was conducting free association sessions in his psychoanalytic practice. [ 45 ] [ 46 ] During these sessions, Beck noticed that thoughts were not as unconscious as Freud had previously theorized, and that certain types of thinking may be the culprits of emotional distress.

[ 39 ] Although the early behavioral approaches were successful in many so-called neurotic disorders , they had little success in treating depression . [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 48 ] Behaviorism was also losing popularity due to the cognitive revolution . The therapeutic approaches of Albert Ellis and Aaron T. Beck gained popularity among behavior therapists, despite the earlier behaviorist rejection of mentalistic concepts like thoughts and cognitions. [ 33 ] Both of these systems included behavioral elements and interventions, with the primary focus being on problems in the present. [ 49 ] [ 50 ] In initial studies, cognitive therapy was often contrasted with behavioral treatments to see which was most effective. During the 1980s and 1990s, cognitive and behavioral techniques were merged into cognitive behavioral therapy. Pivotal to this merging was the successful development of treatments for panic disorder by David M. Clark in the UK and David H. Barlow in the US. [ 34 ] Over time, cognitive behavior therapy came to be known not only as a therapy, but as an umbrella term for all cognitive-based psychotherapies.

Research indicates that ERP is effective in both in-person and remote settings, providing flexibility in treatment delivery without compromising efficacy. [ 91 ] According to The Anxiety and Worry Workbook: The Cognitive Behavioral Solution by Clark and Beck: [ 92 ] In CBT, you work on reducing fear by changing how you think and act. Instead of thinking of the fear object (for example, a spider) as an imminent threat or danger, you're taught to reevaluate the fear object as less threatening to your safety and well-being. Instead of avoiding or running from the fear, you're encouraged to face the fear. One etiological theory of depression is Aaron T. Beck 's cognitive theory of depression. His theory states that depressed people think the way they do because their thinking is biased towards negative interpretations. Beck's theory rests on the aspect of cognitive behavioral therapy known as schemata . [ 93 ] Schemata are the mental maps used to integrate new information into memories and to organize existing information in the mind.

An example of a schema would be a person hearing the word \"dog\" and picturing different versions of the animal that they have grouped together in their mind. [ 93 ] According to this theory, depressed people acquire a negative schema of the world in childhood and adolescence as an effect of stressful life events, and the negative schema is activated later in life when the person encounters similar situations. [ 94 ] Beck also described a negative cognitive triad . The cognitive triad is made up of the depressed individual's negative evaluations of themselves, the world, and the future. Beck suggested that these negative evaluations derive from the negative schemata and cognitive biases of the person. According to this theory, depressed people have views such as \"I never do a good job\", \"It is impossible to have a good day\", and \"things will never get better\". A negative schema helps give rise to the cognitive bias, and the cognitive bias helps fuel the negative schema. Beck further proposed that depressed people often have the following cognitive biases: arbitrary inference , selective abstraction , overgeneralization, magnification, and minimization . These cognitive biases are quick to make negative, generalized, and personal inferences of the self, thus fueling the negative schema. [ 94 ] On the other hand, a positive cognitive triad relates to a person's positive evaluations of themself, the world, and the future. [ 95 ] More specifically, a positive cognitive triad requires self-esteem when viewing oneself and hope for the future.

Cognitive behavioral research suggests a positive cognitive triad bolsters resilience , or the ability to cope with stressful events. Increased levels of resilience is associated with greater resistance to depression . [ 95 ] Another major theoretical approach to cognitive behavioral therapy treatment is the concept of Locus of Control outlined in Julian Rotter's Social Learning Theory . Locus of control refers to the degree to which an individual's sense of control is either internal or external. [ 96 ] An internal locus of control exists when an individual views an outcome of a particular action as being reliant on themselves and their personal attributes whereas an external locus of control exists when an individual views other's or some outside, intangible force such as luck or fate as being responsible for the outcome of a particular action. [ 96 ] A basic concept in some CBT treatments used in anxiety disorders is in vivo exposure . CBT-exposure therapy refers to the direct confrontation of feared objects, activities, or situations by a patient. For example, a woman with PTSD who fears the location where she was assaulted may be assisted by her therapist in going to that location and directly confronting those fears.

[ 99 ] Through exposure to the stimulus, this harmful conditioning can be \"unlearned\" (referred to as extinction and habituation ). CBT for children with phobias is normally delivered over multiple sessions, but one-session treatment has been shown to be equally effective and is cheaper. [ 100 ] [ 101 ] CBT-SP, an adaptation of CBT for suicide prevention (SP), was specifically designed for treating youths who are severely depressed and who have recently attempted suicide within the past 90 days, and was found to be effective, feasible, and acceptable. [ 102 ] Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is a specialist branch of CBT (sometimes referred to as contextual CBT). [ 103 ] [ 104 ] ACT uses mindfulness and acceptance interventions and has been found to have a greater longevity in therapeutic outcomes. In a study with anxiety, CBT and ACT improved similarly across all outcomes from pre- to post-treatment. However, during a 12-month follow-up, ACT proved to be more effective, showing that it is a highly viable lasting treatment model for anxiety disorders.

Today, the humanities are more frequently defined as any fields of study outside of natural sciences , social sciences , formal sciences (like mathematics ), and applied sciences (or professional training ).

[ 1 ] While both fields study human behavior and culture, the humanities adopt an idiographic approach (focusing on the unique and context-specific), emphasizing critical, interpretative, and speculative methods, often with an emphasis on historical context and subjective meaning. In contrast, the social sciences employ a nomothetic approach (seeking general laws and patterns) through empirical and quantitative analysis, a distinction first conceptualized by philosopher Wilhelm Windelband . [ 5 ] This methodological distinction, however, is not absolute. Although sociology , anthropology , archaeology , linguistics , and psychology are commonly classified as social sciences, these fields include scholars who employ qualitative methods closely related to those employed by humanities scholars, such as narrative inquiry , textual analysis , or historical methods. [ 6 ] The humanities have also been justified as fostering self-reflection, civic responsibility, and cultural continuity. Though debates persist about the practical utility of the humanities, proponents argue that their unique focus on meaning, creativity, and critical inquiry contributes both to individual enrichment and the public sphere.

When used as the name of a field of study , history refers to the study and interpretation of the record of humans , societies , institutions, and any topic that has changed over time. [ 11 ] Traditionally, the study of history has been considered a part of the humanities.

While the scientific study of language is known as linguistics and is generally considered a social science , [ 13 ] a natural science [ 14 ] or a cognitive science , [ 15 ] the study of languages is also central to the humanities. A good deal of twentieth- and twenty-first-century philosophy has been devoted to the analysis of language and to the question of whether, as Wittgenstein claimed, many of our philosophical confusions derive from the vocabulary we use; literary theory has explored the rhetorical, associative, and ordering features of language; and historical linguists have studied the development of languages across time.

[ 16 ] The study of law can be seen as either a social science or a humanities discipline, depending on one's perspective. Some see it as a social science because of its objective and measurable nature, while others view it as a humanities discipline because of its focus on values and interpretation. Law is not always enforceable, especially in the international relations context. Law has been defined in various ways, such as \"a system of rules\", [ 17 ] \"an interpretive concept\" for achieving justice, [ 18 ] \"an authority\" to mediate between people's interests, [ 19 ] or \"the command of a sovereign\" backed by the threat of punishment.

[ 18 ] Literature is a term that does not have a universally accepted definition, but which has variably included all written work; writing that possesses literary merit; and language that emphasizes its own literary features, as opposed to ordinary language . Etymologically the term derives from the Latin word literatura /litteratura which means \"writing formed with letters\", although some definitions include spoken or sung texts . Literature can be classified as fiction or non-fiction ; poetry or prose . It can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel , short story or drama ; and works are often categorised according to historical periods, or according to their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations ( genre ). Philosophy—etymologically, the \"love of wisdom\"—is generally the study of problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, justification, truth, justice, right and wrong, beauty, validity, mind, and language. Philosophy is distinguished from other ways of addressing these issues by its critical, generally systematic approach and its reliance on reasoned argument, rather than experiments ( experimental philosophy being an exception).

Still, it continues to overlap with other disciplines. The field of semantics , for example, brings philosophy into contact with linguistics . Since the early twentieth century, philosophy in English-speaking universities has moved away from the humanities and closer to the formal sciences , becoming much more analytic. Analytic philosophy is marked by emphasis on the use of logic and formal methods of reasoning, conceptual analysis, and the use of symbolic and/or mathematical logic , as contrasted with the Continental style of philosophy . [ 21 ] This method of inquiry is largely indebted to the work of philosophers such as Gottlob Frege , Bertrand Russell , G.E. Moore and Ludwig Wittgenstein . Based on current knowledge, it seems that all known cultures, both in the past and present, have some form of belief system or religious practice. While there may be isolated individuals or groups who do not practice any form of religion, it is not known if there has ever been a society that was entirely devoid of religious belief. The definition of religion is not universal, and different cultures may have different ideas about what constitutes religion. Religion may be characterized with a community since humans are social animals . [ 22 ] [ 23 ] Rituals are used to bound the community together. [ 24 ] [ 25 ] Social animals require rules.

Shinto, Daoism, and other folk or natural religions do not have ethical codes. While some religions do include the concept of deities, others do not. Therefore, the supernatural does not necessarily require the existence of deities. Rather, it can be broadly defined as any phenomena that cannot be explained by science or reason.

The performing arts differ from the visual arts in that the former uses the artist's own body, face, and presence as a medium, and the latter uses materials such as clay, metal, or paint, which can be molded or transformed to create some art object . Performing arts include acrobatics , comedy , dance , magic , music , opera , juggling , marching arts , such as brass bands , and theatre . Artists who participate in these arts in front of an audience are called performers, including actors, comedians , dancers , musicians , and singers . Performing arts are also supported by workers in related fields, such as songwriting and stagecraft . Performers often adapt their appearance , such as with costumes and stage makeup , etc. There is also a specialized form of fine art in which the artists perform their work live to an audience. This is called Performance art . Most performance art also involves some form of plastic art, perhaps in the creation of props . Dance was often referred to as a plastic art during the Modern dance era. Musicology as an academic discipline can take a number of different paths, including historical musicology , music literature, ethnomusicology and music theory . Undergraduate music majors generally take courses in all of these areas, while graduate students focus on a particular path.

In addition to the standard narrative dialogue style, theatre takes such forms as opera , ballet , mime , kabuki , classical Indian dance , Chinese opera , mummers' plays , and pantomime . Dance (from Old French dancier , perhaps from Frankish ) generally refers to human movement either used as a form of expression or presented in a social , spiritual or performance setting. Dance is also used to describe methods of non-verbal communication (see body language ) between humans or animals ( bee dance , mating dance), and motion in inanimate objects ( the leaves danced in the wind ). Choreography is the process of creating dances, and the people who create choreography are known as choreographers. Choreographers use movement, music , and other elements to create expressive and artistic dances. They may work alone or with other artists to create new works, and their work can be presented in a variety of settings, from small dance studios to large theaters. Definitions of what constitutes dance are dependent on social , cultural , aesthetic , artistic , and moral constraints and range from functional movement (such as Folk dance ) to codified, virtuoso techniques such as ballet .

Ancient Greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty and anatomically correct proportions. Ancient Roman art depicted gods as idealized humans, shown with characteristic distinguishing features (e.g., Zeus ' thunderbolt). [ 36 ] The emphasis on spiritual and religious themes in Byzantine and Gothic art of the Middle Ages reflected the dominance of the church. However, in the Renaissance , a renewed focus on the physical world was reflected in art forms that depicted the human body and landscape in a more naturalistic and three-dimensional way. [ 36 ] Eastern art has generally worked in a style akin to Western medieval art , namely a concentration on surface patterning and local colour (meaning the plain colour of an object, such as basic red for a red robe, rather than the modulations of that colour brought about by light, shade and reflection). A characteristic of this style is that the local colour is often defined by an outline (a contemporary equivalent is the cartoon). This is evident in, for example, the art of India, Tibet and Japan. Religious Islamic art forbids iconography, and expresses religious ideas through geometry instead.

Increasing global interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into Western art. Drawing is a means of making a picture , using a wide variety of tools and techniques. It generally involves making marks on a surface by applying pressure from a tool, or moving a tool across a surface. Common tools are graphite pencils , pen and ink , inked brushes , wax color pencils , crayons , charcoals , pastels , and markers . Digital tools that simulate the effects of these are also used. The main techniques used in drawing are: line drawing, hatching , crosshatching, random hatching, scribbling, stippling , and blending. A computer aided designer who excels in technical drawing is referred to as a draftsman or draughtsman . Literally, painting is the practice of applying pigment suspended in a carrier (or medium ) and a binding agent (a glue ) to a surface (support) such as paper , canvas or a wall. However, when used in an artistic sense, it means the use of this activity in combination with drawing , composition and other aesthetic considerations in order to manifest the expressive and conceptual intention of the practitioner.

Black is associated with mourning in the West, but elsewhere white may be. Some painters, theoreticians, writers and scientists, including Goethe , Kandinsky , Isaac Newton , have written their own colour theories . Moreover, the use of language is only a generalization for a colour equivalent. The word \" red \", for example, can cover a wide range of variations on the pure red of the spectrum. Unlike music, where notes such as C or C# are universally accepted, there is no formalized register of colors. However, the Pantone system is widely used in the printing and design industry to standardize color reproduction. Modern artists have extended the practice of painting considerably to include, for example, collage . This began with cubism and is not painting in strict sense. Some modern painters incorporate different materials such as sand , cement , straw or wood for their texture. Examples of these are the works of Jean Dubuffet or Anselm Kiefer . Modern and contemporary art has moved away from the historic value of craft in favour of concept ( conceptual art ); this has led some e.g. Joseph Kosuth to say that painting, as a serious art form, is dead, although this has not deterred the majority of artists from continuing to practise it either as whole or part of their work.

In the West, the history of the humanities can be traced to ancient Greece, as the basis of a broad education for citizens. [ 40 ] During Roman times, the concept of the seven liberal arts evolved, involving grammar , rhetoric and logic (the trivium ), along with arithmetic , geometry , astronomy and music (the quadrivium ). [ 41 ] These subjects formed the bulk of medieval education, with the emphasis being on the humanities as skills or \"ways of doing\". A major shift occurred with the Renaissance humanism of the fifteenth century, when the humanities began to be regarded as subjects to study rather than practice, with a corresponding shift away from traditional fields into areas such as literature and history ( studia humaniora ). In the 20th century, this view was in turn challenged by the postmodernist movement, which sought to redefine the humanities in more egalitarian terms suitable for a democratic society since the Greek and Roman societies in which the humanities originated were elitist and aristocratic.

It now encompasses a wide array of additional academic disciplines , including anthropology , archaeology , economics , geography , history , linguistics , management , communication studies , psychology , sociology , culturology , and political science . [ 1 ] The majority of positivist social scientists use methods resembling those used in the natural sciences as tools for understanding societies, and so define science in its stricter modern sense . Speculative social scientists, otherwise known as interpretivist scientists, by contrast, may use social critique or symbolic interpretation rather than constructing empirically falsifiable theories, and thus treat science in its broader sense.

[ 3 ] To gain a deeper understanding of complex human behavior in digital environments, social science disciplines have increasingly integrated interdisciplinary approaches, big data, and computational tools. [ 4 ] The term social research has also acquired a degree of autonomy as practitioners from various disciplines share similar goals and methods.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] The beginnings of the social sciences in the 18th century are reflected in the grand encyclopedia of Diderot , with articles from Jean-Jacques Rousseau and other pioneers. The growth of the social sciences is also reflected in other specialized encyclopedias. The term \"social science\" was coined in French by Mirabeau in 1767, before becoming a distinct conceptual field in the nineteenth century. [ 9 ] Social science was influenced by positivism, focusing on knowledge based on actual positive sense experience and avoiding the negative; metaphysical speculation was avoided. Auguste Comte used the term science sociale to describe the field, taken from the ideas of Charles Fourier ; Comte also referred to the field as social physics . [ 6 ] According to Comte, the social physics field was similar to that of natural sciences . Following this period, five paths of development sprang forth in the social sciences, influenced by Comte in other fields. [ 6 ] One route that was taken was the rise of social research. Large statistical surveys were undertaken in various parts of the United States and Europe .

[ 10 ] The fourth route taken, based in economics, was developed and furthered economic knowledge as a hard science . The last path was the correlation of knowledge and social values ; the antipositivism and verstehen sociology of Max Weber firmly demanded this distinction. In this route, theory (description) and prescription were non-overlapping formal discussions of a subject. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] The foundation of social sciences in the West implies conditioned relationships between progressive and traditional spheres of knowledge. In some contexts, such as the Italian one, sociology slowly affirms itself and experiences the difficulty of affirming a strategic knowledge beyond philosophy and theology. [ 13 ] Around the start of the 20th century, Enlightenment philosophy was challenged in various quarters. After the use of classical theories since the end of the scientific revolution, various fields substituted mathematics studies for experimental studies and examining equations to build a theoretical structure. The development of social science subfields became very quantitative in methodology. The interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary nature of scientific inquiry into human behaviour, social and environmental factors affecting it, made many of the natural sciences interested in some aspects of social science methodology.

In the first half of the 20th century, statistics became a free-standing discipline of applied mathematics. [ 15 ] Statistical methods were used confidently. In the contemporary period, Karl Popper and Talcott Parsons influenced the furtherance of the social sciences. Researchers continue to search for a unified consensus on what methodology might have the power and refinement to connect a proposed \"grand theory\" with the various midrange theories that, with considerable success, continue to provide usable frameworks for massive, growing data banks; for more, see consilience . The social sciences will for the foreseeable future be composed of different zones in the research of, and sometimes distinct in approach toward, the field.

[...] The difference comes down to the fact that social science really wants to be predictive, meaning that man is predictable, while the humanities say that he is not. [ 17 ] The social science disciplines are branches of knowledge taught and researched at the college or university level. Social science disciplines are defined and recognized by the academic journals in which research is published, and the learned social science societies and academic departments or faculties to which their practitioners belong. Social science fields of study usually have several sub-disciplines or branches, and the distinguishing lines between these are often both arbitrary and ambiguous.

[ citation needed ] The anthropological social sciences often develop nuanced descriptions rather than the general laws derived in physics or chemistry, or they may explain individual cases through more general principles, as in many fields of psychology. Anthropology (like some fields of history) does not easily fit into one of these categories, and different branches of anthropology draw on one or more of these domains. [ 20 ] Within the United States, anthropology is divided into four sub-fields: archaeology, physical or biological anthropology , anthropological linguistics , and cultural anthropology . It is an area that is offered at most undergraduate institutions. The word anthropos ( ἄνθρωπος ) in Ancient Greek means \"human being\" or \"person\". Eric Wolf described sociocultural anthropology as \"the most scientific of the humanities, and the most humanistic of the sciences\". [ citation needed ] The goal of anthropology is to provide a holistic account of humans and human nature. This means that, though anthropologists generally specialize in only one sub-field, they always keep in mind the biological, linguistic, historic and cultural aspects of any problem. Since anthropology arose as a science in Western societies that were complex and industrial, a major trend within anthropology has been a methodological drive to study peoples in societies with more simple social organization, sometimes called \"primitive\" in anthropological literature, but without any connotation of \"inferior\".

[ citation needed ] The quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a people in detail, using biogenetic, archaeological, and linguistic data alongside direct observation of contemporary customs. [ 22 ] In the 1990s and 2000s, calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture , of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins, and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard. It is possible to view all human cultures as part of one large, evolving global culture. These dynamic relationships, between what can be observed on the ground, as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology, whether cultural, biological, linguistic or archaeological.

An economist is a person using economic concepts and data in the course of employment, or someone who has earned a degree in the subject.

Another division of the subject distinguishes positive economics, which seeks to predict and explain economic phenomena, from normative economics , which orders choices and actions by some criterion; such orderings necessarily involve subjective value judgments. Since the early part of the 20th century, economics has focused largely on measurable quantities, employing both theoretical models and empirical analysis. Quantitative models, however, can be traced as far back as the physiocratic school . Economic reasoning has been increasingly applied in recent decades to other social situations such as politics , law, psychology , history , religion , marriage and family life, and other social interactions.

[ 27 ] Physical geography examines phenomena related to the measurement of earth . As a result of the two subfields using different approaches a third field has emerged, which is environmental geography . Environmental geography combines physical and human geography and looks at the interactions between the environment and humans. [ 28 ] Other branches of geography include social geography , regional geography , and geomatics . Geographers attempt to understand the Earth in terms of physical and spatial relationships. The first geographers focused on the science of mapmaking and finding ways to precisely project the surface of the earth.

[ citation needed ] Modern geography is an all-encompassing discipline, closely related to Geographic Information Science , that seeks to understand humanity and its natural environment. The fields of urban planning , regional science , and planetology are closely related to geography. Practitioners of geography use many technologies and methods to collect data such as Geographic Information Systems , remote sensing , aerial photography , statistics , and global positioning systems . History is the continuous, systematic narrative and research into past human events as interpreted through historiographical paradigms or theories. When used as the name of a field of study , history refers to the study and interpretation of the record of humans , societies, institutions, and any topic that has changed over time. [ citation needed ] Traditionally, the study of history has been considered a part of the humanities . In modern academia, whether or not history remains a humanities-based subject is contested. In the United States the National Endowment for the Humanities includes history in its definition of humanities (as it does for applied linguistics). [ 29 ] However, the National Research Council classifies history as a social science.

[ 32 ] However, many laws are based on norms accepted by a community and thus have an ethical foundation. The study of law crosses the boundaries between the social sciences and humanities, depending on one's view of research into its objectives and effects. Law is not always enforceable, especially in the international relations context. It has been defined as a \"system of rules\", [ 33 ] as an \"interpretive concept\" [ 34 ] to achieve justice, as an \"authority\" [ 35 ] to mediate people's interests, and even as \"the command of a sovereign, backed by the threat of a sanction\". [ 36 ] However one likes to think of law, it is a completely central social institution. Legal policy incorporates the practical manifestation of thinking from almost every social science and the humanities. Laws are politics, because politicians create them. Law is philosophy, because moral and ethical persuasions shape their ideas. Law tells many of history's stories, because statutes, case law and codifications build up over time. And law is economics, because any rule about contract , tort , property law , labour law , company law and many more can have long-lasting effects on the distribution of wealth.

Physical science is subdivided into physics , astronomy , Earth science , and chemistry . These branches of natural science may be further divided into more specialized branches, also known as fields. As empirical sciences, natural sciences use tools from the formal sciences , such as mathematics and logic , converting information about nature into measurements that can be explained as clear statements of the \" laws of nature \".

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] In natural science, impossibility assertions come to be widely accepted as overwhelmingly probable rather than considered proven to the point of being unchallengeable. The basis for this strong acceptance is a combination of extensive evidence of something not occurring, combined with an underlying theory, very successful in making predictions, whose assumptions lead logically to the conclusion that something is impossible. While an impossibility assertion in natural science can never be proved, it could be refuted by the observation of a single counterexample. Such a counterexample would require that the assumptions underlying the theory that implied the impossibility be re-examined. This field encompasses a diverse set of disciplines that examine phenomena related to living organisms. The scale of study can range from sub-component biophysics up to complex ecologies . Biology is concerned with the characteristics, classification , and behaviors of organisms , as well as how species were formed and their interactions with each other and the environment . The biological fields of botany , zoology , and medicine date back to early periods of civilization, while microbiology was introduced in the 17th century with the invention of the microscope.

Modern biology is divided into subdisciplines by the type of organism and by the scale being studied. Molecular biology is the study of the fundamental chemistry of life, while cellular biology is the examination of the cell; the basic building block of all life. At a higher level, anatomy and physiology look at the internal structures, and their functions, of an organism, while ecology looks at how various organisms interrelate. Earth science (also known as geoscience) is an all-embracing term for the sciences related to the planet Earth , including geology , geography , geophysics , geochemistry , climatology , glaciology , hydrology , meteorology and oceanography . Although mining and precious stones have been human interests throughout the history of civilization, the development of the related sciences of economic geology and mineralogy did not occur until the 18th century. The study of the earth, particularly paleontology , blossomed in the 19th century. The growth of other disciplines, such as geophysics , in the 20th century led to the development of the theory of plate tectonics in the 1960s, which has had a similar effect on the Earth sciences as the theory of evolution had on biology.

Although sometimes considered in conjunction with the Earth sciences, due to the independent development of its concepts, techniques, and practices and also the fact of it having a wide range of sub-disciplines under its wing, atmospheric science is also considered a separate branch of natural science. This field studies the characteristics of different layers of the atmosphere from ground level to the edge of space. The timescale of the study also varies from day to century. Sometimes, the field also includes the study of climatic patterns on planets other than Earth. [ 10 ] The serious study of oceans began in the early- to mid-20th century. As a field of natural science, it is relatively young, but stand-alone programs offer specializations in the subject. Though some controversies remain as to the categorization of the field under earth sciences, interdisciplinary sciences, or as a separate field in its own right, most modern workers in the field agree that it has matured to a state where it has its own paradigms and practices.

Planetary science comprises interconnected observational and theoretical branches. Observational research entails a combination of space exploration , primarily through robotic spacecraft missions utilizing remote sensing , and comparative experimental work conducted in Earth-based laboratories. The theoretical aspect involves extensive mathematical modelling and computer simulation . Typically, planetary scientists are situated within astronomy and physics or Earth sciences departments in universities or research centers. However, there are also dedicated planetary science institutes worldwide. Generally, individuals pursuing a career in planetary science undergo graduate-level studies in one of the Earth sciences, astronomy, astrophysics, geophysics, or physics. They then focus their research within the discipline of planetary science. Major conferences are held annually, and numerous peer-reviewed journals cater to the diverse research interests in planetary science.

Chemistry also involves understanding the properties and interactions of individual atoms and molecules for use in larger-scale applications. Most chemical processes can be studied directly in a laboratory, using a series of (often well-tested) techniques for manipulating materials, as well as an understanding of the underlying processes. Chemistry is often called \" the central science \" because of its role in connecting the other natural sciences. Early experiments in chemistry had their roots in the system of alchemy , a set of beliefs combining mysticism with physical experiments. The science of chemistry began to develop with the work of Robert Boyle , the discoverer of gases , and Antoine Lavoisier , who developed the theory of the conservation of mass . The discovery of the chemical elements and atomic theory began to systematize this science, and researchers developed a fundamental understanding of states of matter , ions , chemical bonds and chemical reactions . The success of this science led to a complementary chemical industry that now plays a significant role in the world economy.

The formulation of theories about the governing laws of the universe has been central to the study of physics from very early on, with philosophy gradually yielding to systematic, quantitative experimental testing and observation as the source of verification. Key historical developments in physics include Isaac Newton 's theory of universal gravitation and classical mechanics , an understanding of electricity and its relation to magnetism , Einstein 's theories of special and general relativity , the development of thermodynamics , and the quantum mechanical model of atomic and subatomic physics. The field of physics is vast and can include such diverse studies as quantum mechanics and theoretical physics , applied physics and optics . Modern physics is becoming increasingly specialized, where researchers tend to focus on a particular area rather than being \"universalists\" like Isaac Newton , Albert Einstein , and Lev Landau , who worked in multiple areas. Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, nebulae, galaxies, and comets.

This discipline is the science of celestial objects and phenomena that originate outside the Earth's atmosphere . It is concerned with the evolution, physics , chemistry , meteorology , geology , and motion of celestial objects, as well as the formation and development of the universe . Astronomy includes examining, studying, and modeling stars, planets, and comets. Most of the information used by astronomers is gathered by remote observation. However, some laboratory reproduction of celestial phenomena has been performed (such as the molecular chemistry of the interstellar medium ).

While the study of celestial features and phenomena can be traced back to antiquity, the scientific methodology of this field began to develop in the middle of the 17th century.

Physics plays a significant role in the other natural sciences, as represented by astrophysics , geophysics , chemical physics , and biophysics . Likewise, chemistry is represented by such fields as biochemistry , physical chemistry , geochemistry , and astrochemistry . A particular example of a scientific discipline that draws upon multiple natural sciences is environmental science .

Oceanography is subcategorized into more specialized cross-disciplines, such as physical oceanography and marine biology . As the marine ecosystem is vast and diverse, marine biology is further divided into many subfields, including specializations in particular species .

Some scholars trace the origins of natural science as far back as pre-literate human societies, where understanding the natural world was necessary for survival. [ 11 ] People observed and built up knowledge about the behavior of animals and the usefulness of plants as food and medicine, which was passed down from generation to generation. [ 11 ] These primitive understandings gave way to more formalized inquiry around 3500 to 3000 BC in the Mesopotamian and Ancient Egyptian cultures, which produced the first known written evidence of natural philosophy , the precursor of natural science. [ 12 ] While the writings show an interest in astronomy, mathematics, and other aspects of the physical world, the ultimate aim of inquiry about nature's workings was, in all cases, religious or mythological, not scientific. [ 13 ] A tradition of scientific inquiry also emerged in Ancient China , where Taoist alchemists and philosophers experimented with elixirs to extend life and cure ailments. [ 14 ] They focused on the yin and yang , or contrasting elements in nature; the yin was associated with femininity and coldness, while yang was associated with masculinity and warmth.

Applied psychology uses human behavior to grab information to locate a main focus in an area that can contribute to finding a resolution.

Solar panels use the photovoltaic effect to convert light into an electric current . [ 2 ] Concentrated solar power systems use lenses or mirrors and solar tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight to a hot spot, often to drive a steam turbine . Photovoltaics (PV) were initially solely used as a source of electricity for small and medium-sized applications, from the calculator powered by a single solar cell to remote homes powered by an off-grid rooftop PV system. Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s. Since then, as the cost of solar panels has fallen, grid-connected solar PV systems ' capacity and production have doubled about every three years . Three-quarters of new generation capacity is solar, [ 3 ] with both millions of rooftop installations and gigawatt-scale photovoltaic power stations continuing to be built. In 2024, solar power generated 7% of global electricity and over 1% of primary energy (2.7% by the substitution method), adding twice as much new electricity as coal. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Along with onshore wind power , utility-scale solar is the source with the cheapest levelised cost of electricity for new installations in most countries.

[ 11 ] Nevertheless solar may greatly cut the cost of energy. [ 5 ] Solar is important for energy security . [ 12 ] Geography affects solar energy potential because some places are sunnier than others. In particular areas that are closer to the equator generally receive more sunshine. However, solar panels that can follow the position of the Sun can significantly increase the solar energy potential in areas that are farther from the equator. [ 13 ] Daytime cloud cover can reduce the light available for solar cells. Land availability also has a large effect on the available solar energy. Solar power plants use one of two technologies: The photovoltaic effect in solar cells converts light into electric current. The first solar cell was constructed by Charles Fritts in the 1880s. [ 17 ] The German industrialist Ernst Werner von Siemens was among those who recognized the importance of this discovery. [ 18 ] In 1931, the German engineer Bruno Lange developed a photo cell using silver selenide in place of copper oxide , [ 19 ] although the prototype selenium cells converted less than 1% of incident light into electricity. Following the work of Russell Ohl in the 1940s, researchers Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller and Daryl Chapin created the silicon solar cell in 1954.

[ 25 ] The array of a photovoltaic system , or PV system, produces direct current (DC) power which fluctuates with the sunlight's intensity. For practical use this usually requires conversion to alternating current (AC), through the use of inverters . [ 16 ] Multiple solar cells are connected inside panels. Panels are wired together to form arrays, then tied to an inverter, which produces power at the desired voltage, and for AC, the desired frequency/phase. [ 16 ] Many residential PV systems are connected to the grid when available, especially in developed countries with large markets. [ 26 ] In these grid-connected PV systems energy storage is optional. In certain applications such as satellites, lighthouses, or in developing countries, batteries or additional power generators are often added as back-ups. Such stand-alone power systems permit operations at night and at other times of limited sunlight.

Thin-film solar cells are commercially used in several technologies, including cadmium telluride (CdTe), copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS), and amorphous thin-film silicon (a-Si, TF-Si).

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] Perovskite materials, such as methylammonium lead halides the all-inorganic cesium lead halide, are cheap to produce and simple to manufacture. Solar-cell efficiencies of laboratory-scale devices using these materials have increased from 3.8% in 2009 [ 31 ] to 27% in 2025 in single-junction architectures, [ 32 ] [ 33 ] and, in silicon-based tandem cells, to 34.85%, [ 32 ] [ 34 ] exceeding the maximum efficiency achieved in single-junction silicon solar cells. Perovskite solar cells have therefore been the fastest-advancing solar technology as of 2016 [update] .

Concentrated solar power (CSP), also called \"concentrated solar thermal\", uses lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to concentrate sunlight, then uses the resulting heat to generate electricity from conventional steam-driven turbines. [ 38 ] As of 2021 [update] the levelized cost of electricity from CSP is over twice that of PV. [ 39 ] As of 2022, less than 1% of solar power comes from CSP. A hybrid system combines solar with energy storage or one or more other forms of generation. Hydro, [ 40 ] [ 41 ] wind [ 42 ] [ 43 ] and batteries [ 44 ] are commonly combined with solar. The combined generation may enable the system to vary power output with demand, or at least smooth the solar power fluctuation. [ 45 ] [ 46 ] There is much hydro worldwide, and adding solar panels on or around existing hydro reservoirs is particularly useful, because hydro is usually more flexible than wind and cheaper at scale than batteries, [ 47 ] and existing power lines can sometimes be used.

Other large CSP plants include the Solnova Solar Power Station (150 MW), the Andasol solar power station (150 MW), and Extresol Solar Power Station (150 MW), all in Spain. The principal advantage of CSP is the ability to efficiently add thermal storage, allowing the dispatching of electricity over up to a 24-hour period. Since peak electricity demand typically occurs at about 5 pm, many CSP power plants use 3 to 5 hours of thermal storage. [ 78 ] In many countries, solar power is the lowest cost source of electricity. [ 79 ] The typical cost factors for solar power include the costs of the modules, the frame to hold them, wiring, inverters, labour cost, any land that might be required, the grid connection, maintenance and the solar insolation that location will receive.

This article deals only with wind power for electricity generation. Today, wind power is generated almost completely using wind turbines , generally grouped into wind farms and connected to the electrical grid . In 2024, wind supplied about 2,500 TWh of electricity, which was over 8% of world electricity. [ 1 ] With about 100 GW added during 2021, mostly in China and the United States , global installed wind power capacity exceeded 800 GW. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] 30 countries generated more than a tenth of their electricity from wind power in 2024 and wind generation has nearly tripled since 2015. [ 1 ] To help meet the Paris Agreement goals to limit climate change , analysts say it should expand much faster – by over 1% of electricity generation per year. [ 5 ] Wind power is a sustainable , renewable energy source, and has a much smaller impact on the environment than burning fossil fuels . Wind power is variable , so it needs energy storage or other dispatchable generation energy sources to attain a reliable supply of electricity. Land-based (onshore) wind farms have a greater visual impact on the landscape than most other power stations per energy produced. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Wind farms sited offshore have less visual impact and have higher capacity factors , although they are generally more expensive. [ 2 ] Offshore wind power currently has a share of about 10% of new installations. [ 8 ] Wind power is one of the lowest-cost electricity sources per unit of energy produced."

In many locations, new onshore wind farms are cheaper than new coal or gas plants . [ 9 ] Regions in the higher northern and southern latitudes have the highest potential for wind power. [ 10 ] In most regions, wind power generation is higher in nighttime, and in winter when solar power output is low. So combinations of wind and solar power are suitable in many countries. [ 11 ] Wind is air movement in the Earth's atmosphere . In a unit of time, say 1 second, the volume of air that had passed an area A {\\displaystyle A} is A v {\\displaystyle Av} . If the air density is ρ {\\displaystyle \\rho } , the flow rate of this volume of air is M Δ t = ρ A v {\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {M}{\\Delta t}}=\\rho Av} , and the power transfer, or energy transfer per second is P = 1 2 M Δ t v 2 = 1 2 ρ A v 3 {\\displaystyle P={\\tfrac {1}{2}}{\\tfrac {M}{\\Delta t}}v^{2}={\\tfrac {1}{2}}\\rho Av^{3}} . Wind power is thus proportional to the third power of the wind speed; the available power increases eightfold when the wind speed doubles. Change of wind speed by a factor of 2.1544 increases the wind power by one order of magnitude (multiply by 10).

The atmosphere acts as a thermal engine, absorbing heat at higher temperatures, releasing heat at lower temperatures. The process is responsible for the production of wind kinetic energy at a rate of 2.46 W/m 2 thus sustaining the circulation of the atmosphere against friction. [ 14 ] Through wind resource assessment , it is possible to estimate wind power potential globally, by country or region, or for a specific site. The Global Wind Atlas provided by the Technical University of Denmark in partnership with the World Bank provides a global assessment of wind power potential. [ 12 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] Unlike 'static' wind resource atlases which average estimates of wind speed and power density across multiple years, tools such as Renewables.ninja provide time-varying simulations of wind speed and power output from different wind turbine models at an hourly resolution. [ 17 ] More detailed, site-specific assessments of wind resource potential can be obtained from specialist commercial providers, and many of the larger wind developers have in-house modeling capabilities. The total amount of economically extractable power available from the wind is considerably more than present human power use from all sources. [ 18 ] The strength of wind varies, and an average value for a given location does not alone indicate the amount of energy a wind turbine could produce there.

The Weibull model closely mirrors the actual distribution of hourly/ten-minute wind speeds at many locations. The Weibull factor is often close to 2 and therefore a Rayleigh distribution can be used as a less accurate, but simpler model. [ 20 ] A wind farm is a group of wind turbines in the same location. A large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines distributed over an extended area. The land between the turbines may be used for agricultural or other purposes. A wind farm may also be located offshore. Almost all large wind turbines have the same design — a horizontal axis wind turbine having an upwind rotor with 3 blades, attached to a nacelle on top of a tall tubular tower. In a wind farm, individual turbines are interconnected with a medium voltage (often 34.5 kV) power collection system [ 25 ] and communications network. In general, a distance of 7D (7 times the rotor diameter of the wind turbine) is set between each turbine in a fully developed wind farm. [ 26 ] At a substation, this medium-voltage electric current is increased in voltage with a transformer for connection to the high voltage electric power transmission system.

[ 39 ] When the transmission capacity does not meet the generation capacity, wind farms are forced to produce below their full potential or stop running altogether, in a process known as curtailment . While this leads to potential renewable generation left untapped, it prevents possible grid overload or risk to reliable service. [ 40 ] One of the biggest current challenges to wind power grid integration in some countries is the necessity of developing new transmission lines to carry power from wind farms, usually in remote lowly populated areas due to availability of wind, to high load locations, usually on the coasts where population density is higher. [ 41 ] Any existing transmission lines in remote locations may not have been designed for the transport of large amounts of energy.

[ 5 ] Expansion of wind power is being hindered by fossil fuel subsidies . [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] The actual amount of electric power that wind can generate is calculated by multiplying the nameplate capacity by the capacity factor , which varies according to equipment and location. Estimates of the capacity factors for wind installations are in the range of 35% to 44%. [ 49 ] Since wind speed is not constant, a wind farm's annual energy production is never as much as the sum of the generator nameplate ratings multiplied by the total hours in a year. The ratio of actual productivity in a year to this theoretical maximum is called the capacity factor. Online data is available for some locations, and the capacity factor can be calculated from the yearly output. [ 50 ] [ 51 ] Wind energy penetration is the fraction of energy produced by wind compared with the total generation.

[ 56 ] These studies have been for locations with geographically dispersed wind farms, some degree of dispatchable energy or hydropower with storage capacity, demand management, and interconnected to a large grid area enabling the export of electric power when needed. Electrical utilities continue to study the effects of large-scale penetration of wind generation on system stability. [ 57 ] A wind energy penetration figure can be specified for different duration of time but is often quoted annually. To generate almost all electricity from wind annually requires substantial interconnection to other systems, for example some wind power in Scotland is sent to the rest of the British grid . [ 58 ] On a monthly, weekly, daily, or hourly basis—or less—wind might supply as much as or more than 100% of current use, with the rest stored, exported or curtailed. The seasonal industry might then take advantage of high wind and low usage times such as at night when wind output can exceed normal demand. Such industry might include the production of silicon, aluminum, [ 59 ] steel, or natural gas, and hydrogen, and using future long-term storage to facilitate 100% energy from variable renewable energy .

[ 64 ] Wind power is variable, and during low wind periods, it may need to be replaced by other power sources. Transmission networks presently cope with outages of other generation plants and daily changes in electrical demand, but the variability of intermittent power sources such as wind power is more frequent than those of conventional power generation plants which, when scheduled to be operating, may be able to deliver their nameplate capacity around 95% of the time. Electric power generated from wind power can be highly variable at several different timescales: hourly, daily, or seasonally. Annual variation also exists but is not as significant. [ citation needed ] Because instantaneous electrical generation and consumption must remain in balance to maintain grid stability, this variability can present substantial challenges to incorporating large amounts of wind power into a grid system. Intermittency and the non- dispatchable nature of wind energy production can raise costs for regulation, incremental operating reserve , and (at high penetration levels) could require an increase in the already existing energy demand management , load shedding , storage solutions, or system interconnection with HVDC cables. Fluctuations in load and allowance for the failure of large fossil-fuel generating units require operating reserve capacity, which can be increased to compensate for the variability of wind generation. Utility-scale batteries are often used to balance hourly and shorter timescale variation, [ 65 ] [ 66 ] but car batteries may gain ground from the mid-2020s."

Integrating ever-higher levels of renewables is being successfully demonstrated in the real world. [ 69 ] Solar power tends to be complementary to wind. [ 71 ] [ 72 ] On daily to weekly timescales, high-pressure areas tend to bring clear skies and low surface winds, whereas low-pressure areas tend to be windier and cloudier. On seasonal timescales, solar energy peaks in summer, whereas in many areas wind energy is lower in summer and higher in winter.

When the wind is blowing strongly, nearby hydroelectric stations can temporarily hold back their water. When the wind drops they can, provided they have the generation capacity, rapidly increase production to compensate. This gives a very even overall power supply and virtually no loss of energy and uses no more water. Alternatively, where a suitable head of water is not available, pumped-storage hydroelectricity or other forms of grid energy storage such as compressed air energy storage and thermal energy storage can store energy developed by high-wind periods and release it when needed.

The potential revenue from this arbitrage can offset the cost and losses of storage.

Energy cost estimates are highly dependent on these assumptions so published cost figures can differ substantially.

By the late 19th century, the electrical generator was developed and could now be coupled with hydraulics.

[ 15 ] In 1878, the world's first hydroelectric power scheme was developed at Cragside in Northumberland , England, by William Armstrong . It was used to power a single arc lamp in his art gallery.

[ 17 ] By 1886 there were 45 hydroelectric power stations in the United States and Canada; and by 1889 there were 200 in the United States alone. [ 14 ] At the beginning of the 20th century, many small hydroelectric power stations were being constructed by commercial companies in mountains near metropolitan areas. Grenoble , France held the International Exhibition of Hydropower and Tourism , [ 18 ] with over one million visitors 1925. By 1920, when 40% of the power produced in the United States was hydroelectric, the Federal Power Act was enacted into law. The Act created the Federal Power Commission to regulate hydroelectric power stations on federal land and water. As the power stations became larger, their associated dams developed additional purposes, including flood control , irrigation and navigation . Federal funding became necessary for large-scale development, and federally owned corporations, such as the Tennessee Valley Authority (1933) and the Bonneville Power Administration (1937) were created. [ 15 ] Additionally, the Bureau of Reclamation which had begun a series of western US irrigation projects in the early 20th century, was now constructing large hydroelectric projects such as the 1928 Hoover Dam .

Hydroelectricity would eventually supply some countries, including Norway , Democratic Republic of the Congo , Paraguay and Brazil , with over 85% of their electricity. In 2021 the International Energy Agency (IEA) said that more efforts are needed to help limit climate change . [ 23 ] Some countries have highly developed their hydropower potential and have very little room for growth: Switzerland produces 88% of its potential and Mexico 80%.

[ 2 ] : 67 Most hydroelectric power comes from the potential energy of dammed water driving a water turbine and generator . The power extracted from the water depends on the volume and on the difference in height between the source and the water's outflow. This height difference is called the head . A large pipe (the \" penstock \") delivers water from the reservoir to the turbine. [ 25 ] This method produces electricity to supply high peak demands by moving water between reservoirs at different elevations. At times of low electrical demand, the excess generation capacity is used to pump water into the higher reservoir, thus providing demand side response . [ 2 ] When the demand becomes greater, water is released back into the lower reservoir through a turbine. In 2021 pumped-storage schemes provided almost 85% of the world's 190 GW of grid energy storage [ 2 ] and improve the daily capacity factor of the generation system. Pumped storage is not an energy source, and appears as a negative number in listings. [ 26 ] Run-of-the-river hydroelectric stations are those with small or no reservoir capacity, so that only the water coming from upstream is available for generation at that moment, and any oversupply must pass unused. A constant supply of water from a lake or existing reservoir upstream is a significant advantage in choosing sites for run-of-the-river.

Less common types of hydro schemes use water's kinetic energy or undammed sources such as undershot water wheels . Tidal power is viable in a relatively small number of locations around the world. [ 28 ] Conduit hydroelectricity stations use mechanical energy of water as part of the water delivery system through man-made conduits to generate electricity. Generally, the conduits are existing water pipelines such as in public water supply . [ 29 ] Some definitions expand the definition of conduits to be existing tunnels, canals, or aqueducts that are used primarily for other water delivery purposes than electricity generation. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] The classification of hydropower plants starts with two top-level categories: [ 32 ] The classification of a plant as an SHP or LHP is primarily based on its nameplate capacity , the threshold varies by the country, but in any case a plant with the capacity of 50 MW or more is considered an LHP. [ 33 ] As an example, for China, SHP power is below 25 MW, for India - below 15 MW, most of Europe - below 10 MW. [ 34 ] The SHP and LHP categories are further subdivided into many subcategories that are not mutually exclusive.

Therefore, the term SHP is frequently used as a synonym for the run-of-the-river power plant . [ 33 ] The largest power producers in the world are hydroelectric power stations, with some hydroelectric facilities capable of generating more than double the installed capacities of the current largest nuclear power stations . Although no official definition exists for the capacity range of large hydroelectric power stations, facilities from over a few hundred megawatts are generally considered large hydroelectric facilities. [ 36 ] Currently, only seven facilities over 10 GW ( 10,000 MW ) are in operation worldwide, see table below.

This decreased environmental impact depends strongly on the balance between stream flow and power production. [ 41 ] [ citation needed ] Micro hydro means hydroelectric power installations that typically produce up to 100 kW of power. These installations can provide power to an isolated home or small community, or are sometimes connected to electric power networks. There are many of these installations around the world, particularly in developing nations as they can provide an economical source of energy without purchase of fuel. [ 42 ] Micro hydro systems complement photovoltaic solar energy systems because in many areas water flow, and thus available hydro power, is highest in the winter when solar energy is at a minimum. Pico hydro is hydroelectric power generation of under 5 kW . It is useful in small, remote communities that require only a small amount of electricity. For example, the 1.1 kW Intermediate Technology Development Group Pico Hydro Project in Kenya supplies 57 homes with very small electric loads (e.g., a couple of lights and a phone charger, or a small TV/radio).

An underground power station is generally used at large facilities and makes use of a large natural height difference between two waterways, such as a waterfall or mountain lake. A tunnel is constructed to take water from the high reservoir to the generating hall built in a cavern near the lowest point of the water tunnel and a horizontal tailrace taking water away to the lower outlet waterway. A simple formula for approximating electric power production at a hydroelectric station is: P = − η ( m ˙ g Δ h ) = − η ( ( ρ V ˙ ) g Δ h ) {\\displaystyle P=-\\eta \\ ({\\dot {m}}g\\ \\Delta h)=-\\eta \\ ((\\rho {\\dot {V}})\\ g\\ \\Delta h)} where Efficiency is often higher (that is, closer to 1) with larger and more modern turbines. Annual electric energy production depends on the available water supply. In some installations, the water flow rate can vary by a factor of 10:1 over the course of a year.

[ 46 ] Power generation can also be decreased quickly when there is a surplus power generation. [ 47 ] Hence the limited capacity of hydropower units is not generally used to produce base power except for vacating the flood pool or meeting downstream needs. [ 48 ] Instead, it can serve as backup for non-hydro generators. [ 47 ] The major advantage of conventional hydroelectric dams with reservoirs is their ability to store water at low cost for dispatch later as high value clean electricity. In 2021, the IEA estimated that the \"reservoirs of all existing conventional hydropower plants combined can store a total of 1,500 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electrical energy in one full cycle\" which was \"about 170 times more energy than the global fleet of pumped storage hydropower plants\". [ 2 ] Battery storage capacity is not expected to overtake pumped storage during the 2020s.

It has been calculated that the sale of electricity from the Three Gorges Dam will cover the construction costs after 5 to 8 years of full generation. [ 50 ] However, some data shows that in most countries large hydropower dams will be too costly and take too long to build to deliver a positive risk adjusted return, unless appropriate risk management measures are put in place. [ 51 ] While many hydroelectric projects supply public electricity networks, some are created to serve specific industrial enterprises. Dedicated hydroelectric projects are often built to provide the substantial amounts of electricity needed for aluminium electrolytic plants, for example. The Grand Coulee Dam switched to support Alcoa aluminium in Bellingham, Washington , United States for American World War II airplanes before it was allowed to provide irrigation and power to citizens (in addition to aluminium power) after the war. In Suriname , the Brokopondo Reservoir was constructed to provide electricity for the Alcoa aluminium industry. New Zealand 's Manapouri Power Station was constructed to supply electricity to the aluminium smelter at Tiwai Point .

Reservoirs created by hydroelectric schemes often provide facilities for water sports , and become tourist attractions themselves. In some countries, aquaculture in reservoirs is common. Multi-use dams installed for irrigation support agriculture with a relatively constant water supply. Large hydro dams can control floods, which would otherwise affect people living downstream of the project.

Water exiting a turbine usually contains very little suspended sediment, which can lead to scouring of river beds and loss of riverbanks. [ 56 ] The turbines also will kill large portions of the fauna passing through, for instance 70% of the eel passing a turbine will perish immediately. [ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] Since turbine gates are often opened intermittently, rapid or even daily fluctuations in river flow are observed. [ 60 ] Drought and seasonal changes in rainfall can severely limit hydropower. [ 2 ] Water may also be lost by evaporation. [ 61 ] When water flows it has the ability to transport particles heavier than itself downstream. This has a negative effect on dams and subsequently their power stations, particularly those on rivers or within catchment areas with high siltation. Siltation can fill a reservoir and reduce its capacity to control floods along with causing additional horizontal pressure on the upstream portion of the dam. Eventually, some reservoirs can become full of sediment and useless or over-top during a flood and fail.

Geothermal power (generation of electricity from geothermal energy), has been used since the 20th century. Geothermal power plants produce power at a constant rate, without regard to weather conditions. Geothermal resources are theoretically more than adequate to supply humanity's energy needs. Most extraction occurs in areas near tectonic plate boundaries . The cost of generating geothermal power decreased by 25% during the 1980s and 1990s. [ 1 ] Technological advances continued to reduce costs and thereby expand the amount of viable resources. In 2021, the US Department of Energy estimated that power from a newly built plant costs about $0.05/kWh. [ 2 ] In 2019, 13,900 megawatts (MW) of geothermal power was available worldwide.

In 1892, the US's first district heating system in Boise, Idaho , was powered by geothermal energy. It was copied in Klamath Falls, Oregon , in 1900. The world's first known building to utilize geothermal energy as its primary heat source was the Hot Lake Hotel in Union County, Oregon , beginning in 1907.

Dry steam, flash steam, and binary cycle power stations have been used for this purpose. As of 2010 geothermal electricity was generated in 26 countries. [ 23 ] [ 24 ] As of 2019, worldwide geothermal power capacity amounted to 15.4 gigawatts (GW), of which 23.86% or 3.68 GW were in the United States . [ 25 ] Geothermal energy supplies a significant share of the electrical power in Iceland , El Salvador , Kenya , the Philippines and New Zealand . [ 26 ] Geothermal power is considered to be a renewable energy because heat extraction rates are insignificant compared to the Earth's heat content . [ 20 ] The greenhouse gas emissions of geothermal electric stations are on average 45 grams of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour of electricity, or less than 5% of that of coal-fired plants. [ 27 ] Geothermal electric plants were traditionally built on the edges of tectonic plates where high-temperature geothermal resources approach the surface. These plants are usually built on land where the subsurface has high temperatures,"

Approximately seventy countries made direct use of a total of 270 PJ of geothermal heating in 2004. As of 2007, 28 GW of geothermal heating satisfied 0.07% of global primary energy consumption. [ 4 ] Thermal efficiency is high since no energy conversion is needed, but capacity factors tend to be low (around 20%) since the heat is mostly needed in the winter.

Hydrothermal systems produce geothermal energy by accessing naturally occurring hydrothermal reservoirs. Hydrothermal systems come in either vapor-dominated or liquid-dominated forms. Larderello and The Geysers are vapor-dominated. Vapor-dominated sites offer temperatures from 240 to 300 °C that produce superheated steam. Liquid-dominated reservoirs (LDRs) are more common with temperatures greater than 200 °C (392 °F) and are found near volcanoes in/around the Pacific Ocean and in rift zones and hot spots. Flash plants are the common way to generate electricity from these sources. Steam from the well is sufficient to power the plant. Most wells generate 2–10 MW of electricity. Steam is separated from liquid via cyclone separators and drives electric generators. Condensed liquid returns down the well for reheating/reuse. As of 2013, the largest liquid system was Cerro Prieto in Mexico, which generates 750 MW of electricity from temperatures reaching 350 °C (662 °F). Lower-temperature LDRs (120–200 °C or 248–392 °F) require pumping. They are common in extensional terrains, where heating takes place via deep circulation along faults, such as in the Western US and Turkey. Water passes through a heat exchanger in a Rankine cycle binary plant. The water vaporizes an organic working fluid that drives a turbine .

Engineered geothermal systems are used in a variety of geothermal reservoirs that have hot rocks but insufficient natural reservoir quality, for example, insufficient geofluid quantity or insufficient rock permeability or porosity, to operate as natural hydrothermal systems. Types of engineered geothermal systems include enhanced geothermal systems , closed-loop or advanced geothermal systems , and some superhot rock geothermal systems . [ 36 ] Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) actively inject water into wells to be heated and pumped back out. The water is injected under high pressure to expand existing rock fissures to enable the water to flow freely. The technique was adapted from oil and gas fracking techniques. The geologic formations are deeper and no toxic chemicals are used, reducing the possibility of environmental damage. Instead proppants such as sand or ceramic particles are used to keep the cracks open and producing optimal flow rates. [ 37 ] Drillers can employ directional drilling to expand the reservoir size. [ 12 ] Small-scale EGS have been installed in the Rhine Graben at Soultz-sous-Forêts in France and at Landau and Insheim in Germany. [ 12 ] Closed-loop geothermal systems, sometimes colloquially referred to as Advanced Geothermal Systems (AGS), are engineered geothermal systems containing subsurface working fluid that is heated in the hot rock reservoir without direct contact with rock pores and fractures. Instead, the subsurface working fluid stays inside a closed loop of deeply buried pipes that conduct Earth's heat. The advantages of a deep, closed-loop geothermal circuit include: (1) no need for a geofluid, (2) no need for the hot rock to be permeable or porous, and (3)"

[ 36 ] Eavor tm , a Canadian-based geothermal startup, piloted their closed-loop system in shallow soft rock formations in Alberta, Canada. Situated within a sedimentary basin, the geothermal gradient proved to be insufficient for electrical power generation. However, the system successfully produced approximately 11,000 MWh of thermal energy during its initial two years of operation.\" [ 38 ] [ 39 ] As with wind and solar energy, geothermal power has minimal operating costs; capital costs dominate. Drilling accounts for over half the costs, and not all wells produce exploitable resources. For example, as of 2009 a typical well pair (one for extraction and one for injection) in Nevada can produce 4.5 megawatts (MW) and costs about $10 million to drill, with a 20% failure rate, making the average cost of a successful well $50 million. [ 40 ] Drilling geothermal wells is more expensive than drilling oil and gas wells of comparable depth for several reasons: As of 2007 plant construction and well drilling cost about €2–5 million per MW of electrical capacity, while the break-even price was 0.04–0.10 € per kW·h. [ 10 ] Enhanced geothermal systems tend to be on the high side of these ranges, with capital costs above $4 million per MW and break-even above $0.054 per kW·h.

The mix between private and public funding varies among different renewable energy technologies, influenced by their market appeal and readiness. In 2020, geothermal energy received just 32% of its investment from private sources. [ 43 ] [ 44 ] In January 2024, the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) report \"Socioeconomic Impacts of Geothermal Energy Development\" was published, highlighting the substantial socioeconomic benefits of geothermal energy development, which notably exceeds those of wind and solar by generating an estimated 34 jobs per megawatt across various sectors. The report details how geothermal projects contribute to skill development through practical on-the-job training and formal education, thereby strengthening the local workforce and expanding employment opportunities. It also underscores the collaborative nature of geothermal development with local communities , which leads to improved infrastructure, skill-building programs, and revenue-sharing models, thereby enhancing access to reliable electricity and heat. These improvements have the potential to boost agricultural productivity and food security . The report further addresses the commitment to advancing gender equality and social inclusion by offering job opportunities, education, and training to underrepresented groups, ensuring fair access to the benefits of geothermal development. Collectively, these efforts are instrumental in driving domestic economic growth, increasing fiscal revenues, and contributing to more stable and diverse national economies, while also offering significant social benefits such as better health, education, and community cohesion.

Many projects are canceled during the stages of reconnaissance and geophysical surveys, which are unsuitable for traditional lending. At later stages can often be equity-financed. [ 46 ] A common issue encountered in geothermal systems arises when the system is situated in carbonate-rich formations. In such cases, the fluids extracting heat from the subsurface often dissolve fragments of the rock during their ascent towards the surface, where they subsequently cool. As the fluids cool, dissolved cations precipitate out of solution, leading to the formation of calcium scale, a phenomenon known as calcite scaling. This calcite scaling has the potential to decrease flow rates and necessitate system downtime for maintenance purposes. [ 47 ] Geothermal energy is considered to be sustainable because the heat extracted is so small compared to the Earth's heat content, which is approximately 100 billion times 2010 worldwide annual energy consumption. [ 4 ] Earth's heat flows are not in equilibrium; the planet is cooling on geologic timescales. Anthropic heat extraction typically does not accelerate the cooling process. Wells can further be considered renewable because they return the extracted water to the borehole for reheating and re-extraction, albeit at a lower temperature. Replacing material use with energy has reduced the human environmental footprint in many applications. Geothermal has the potential to allow further reductions. For example, Iceland has sufficient geothermal energy to eliminate fossil fuels for electricity production and to heat Reykjavik sidewalks and eliminate the need for gritting.

The three oldest sites, at Larderello, Wairakei , and the Geysers experienced reduced output because of local depletion. Heat and water, in uncertain proportions, were extracted faster than they were replenished. Reducing production and injecting additional water could allow these wells to recover their original capacity. Such strategies have been implemented at some sites. These sites continue to provide significant energy. [ 49 ] [ 50 ] The Wairakei power station was commissioned in November 1958, and it attained its peak generation of 173 MW in 1965, but already the supply of high-pressure steam was faltering. In 1982 it was down-rated to intermediate pressure and the output to 157 MW. In 2005, two 8 MW isopentane systems were added, boosting output by about 14 MW. Detailed data were lost due to re-organisations. Fluids drawn from underground carry a mixture of gasses, notably carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ), hydrogen sulfide ( H 2 S ), methane ( CH 4 ) and ammonia ( NH 3 ). These pollutants contribute to global warming , acid rain and noxious smells if released. Existing geothermal electric plants emit an average of 122 kilograms (269 lb) of CO 2 per megawatt-hour (MW·h) of electricity, a small fraction of the emission intensity of fossil fuel plants.

The modern practice of returning geothermal fluids into the Earth to stimulate production has the side benefit of reducing this environmental impact. Construction can adversely affect land stability.

Carbon footprints are usually reported in tonnes of emissions ( CO 2 -equivalent ) per unit of comparison. Such units can be for example tonnes CO 2 -eq per year , per kilogram of protein for consumption , per kilometer travelled , per piece of clothing and so forth. A product's carbon footprint includes the emissions for the entire life cycle . These run from the production along the supply chain to its final consumption and disposal. Similarly, an organization's carbon footprint includes the direct as well as the indirect emissions that it causes. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol (for carbon accounting of organizations) calls these Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions . There are several methodologies and online tools to calculate the carbon footprint. They depend on whether the focus is on a country, organization, product or individual person. For example, the carbon footprint of a product could help consumers decide which product to buy if they want to be climate aware . For climate change mitigation activities, the carbon footprint can help distinguish those economic activities with a high footprint from those with a low footprint. So the carbon footprint concept allows everyone to make comparisons between the climate impacts of individuals, products, companies and countries.

[ 2 ] In some definitions, only the carbon dioxide emissions are taken into account. These do not include other greenhouse gases , such as methane and nitrous oxide . [ 3 ] Various methods to calculate the carbon footprint exist, and these may differ somewhat for different entities. For organizations it is common practice to use the Greenhouse Gas Protocol . It includes three carbon emission scopes. Scope 1 refers to direct carbon emissions. Scope 2 and 3 refer to indirect carbon emissions. Scope 3 emissions are those indirect emissions that result from the activities of an organization but come from sources which they do not own or control.

Consumption-based accounting using input-output analysis backed by super-computing makes it possible to analyse global supply chains . Countries also prepare national GHG inventories for the UNFCCC .

[ 7 ] Comprehensive carbon footprint reporting looks at the final demand for emissions, to where the consumption of the goods and services takes place. [ 8 ] A formal definition of carbon footprint is as follows: \"A measure of the total amount of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and methane (CH 4 ) emissions of a defined population, system or activity, considering all relevant sources, sinks and storage within the spatial and temporal boundary of the population, system or activity of interest.

They may report them per year, per person, per kilogram of protein, per kilometer travelled, and so on. In the definition of carbon footprint, some scientists include only CO 2. But more commonly they include several of the notable greenhouse gases . They can compare various greenhouse gases by using carbon dioxide equivalents over a relevant time scale, like 100 years. Some organizations use the term greenhouse gas footprint or climate footprint [ 10 ] to emphasize that all greenhouse gases are included, not just carbon dioxide.

It defines the carbon footprint as the \"measure of the exclusive total amount of emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) that is directly and indirectly caused by an activity or is accumulated over the lifecycle stages of a product.\" [ 3 ] : 1796 The IPCC report's authors adopted the same definition that had been proposed in 2007 in the UK. [ 12 ] That publication included only carbon dioxide in the definition of carbon footprint. It justified this with the argument that other greenhouse gases were more difficult to quantify. This is because of their differing global warming potentials. They also stated that an inclusion of all greenhouse gases would make the carbon footprint indicator less practical.

One disadvantage of not including methane is that some products or sectors that have a high methane footprint such as livestock [ 13 ] appear less harmful for the climate than they actually are.

Carbon footprints can be calculated at different scales. They can apply to whole countries, cities, [ 47 ] neighborhoods and also sectors, companies and products. [ 48 ] Several free online carbon footprint calculators exist to calculate personal carbon footprints. [ 49 ] [ 50 ] Software such as the \"Scope 3 Evaluator\" can help companies report emissions throughout their value chain. [ 51 ] The software tools can help consultants and researchers to model global sustainability footprints. In each situation there are a number of questions that need to be answered. These include which activities are linked to which emissions, and which proportion should be attributed to which company. Software is essential for company management. But there is a need for new ways of enterprise resource planning to improve corporate sustainability performance. [ 52 ] To achieve 95% carbon footprint coverage, it would be necessary to assess 12 million individual supply-chain contributions. This is based on analyzing 12 sectoral case studies.

The production-based approach includes only impacts physically produced in the country in question. [ 55 ] Consumption-based accounting redistributes the emissions from production-based accounting. It considers that emissions in another country are necessary for the home country's consumption bundle. [ 55 ] Consumer-based accounting is based on input-output analysis. It is used at the highest levels for any economic research question related to environmental or social impacts. [ 56 ] Analysis of global supply chains is possible using consumption-based accounting with input-output analysis assisted by super-computing capacity. Leontief created Input-output analysis (IO) to demonstrate the relationship between consumption and production in an economy. It incorporates the entire supply chain. It uses input-output tables from countries' national accounts. It also uses international data such as UN Comtrade and Eurostat . Input-output analysis has been extended globally to multi-regional input-output analysis (MRIO). Innovations and technology enabling the analysis of billions of supply chains made this possible. Standards set by the United Nations underpin this analysis. [ 57 ] : 280 The analysis enables a Structural Path Analysis. This scans and ranks the top supply chain nodes and paths. It conveniently lists hotspots for urgent action. Input-output analysis has increased in popularity because of its ability to examine global value chains .

Some widely recognized procedures for LCA are included in the ISO 14000 series of environmental management standards. A standard called ISO 14040:2006 provides the framework for conducting an LCA study. [ 60 ] ISO 14060 family of standards provides further sophisticated tools. Also the latest standard, ISO 14064:2018 has the right set of tools that will help reduce Carbon Emissions in Corporations. [ 61 ] These are used to quantify, monitor, report and validate or verify GHG emissions and removals. [ 62 ] Greenhouse gas product life cycle assessments can also comply with specifications such as Publicly Available Specification (PAS) 2050 and the GHG Protocol Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard . [ 63 ] [ 64 ] An advantage of LCA is the high level of detail that can be obtained on-site or by liaising with suppliers. However, LCA has been hampered by the artificial construction of a boundary after which no further impacts of upstream suppliers are considered. This can introduce significant truncation errors . LCA has been combined with input-output analysis. This enables on-site detailed knowledge to be incorporated. IO connects to global economic databases to incorporate the entire supply chain.

[ 66 ] [ 68 ] Geoffrey Supran and Naomi Oreskes of Harvard University argue that concepts such as carbon footprints \"hamstring us, and they put blinders on us, to the systemic nature of the climate crisis and the importance of taking collective action to address the problem\". [ 69 ] [ 70 ] While the focus on individual behaviour has shaped public discourse, scientific assessments emphasize that this approach alone is insufficient. The IPCC notes that individual behavioural changes alone are insufficient to achieve deep emission reductions. In its Sixth Assessment Report (2023), the IPCC stated that \"Demand-side measures and new ways of end-use service provision can reduce global GHG emissions in end-use sectors by 40–70% by 2050 compared to baseline scenarios\" [ 71 ] This highlights the need to combine lifestyle changes with systemic transitions—such as clean energy systems, electrification of transport and heating, and collective infrastructure solutions—to effectively address climate change.

It can be measured on various levels, for example, genetic variability , species diversity , ecosystem diversity and phylogenetic diversity.

Tropical forest ecosystems cover less than one-fifth of Earth's terrestrial area and contain about 50% of the world's species. [ 2 ] There are latitudinal gradients in species diversity for both marine and terrestrial taxa . [ 3 ] Since life began on Earth , six major mass extinctions and several minor events have led to large and sudden drops in biodiversity. The Phanerozoic aeon (the last 540 million years) marked a rapid growth in biodiversity via the Cambrian explosion . In this period, the majority of multicellular phyla first appeared. The next 400 million years included repeated, massive biodiversity losses. Those events have been classified as mass extinction events. In the Carboniferous , rainforest collapse may have led to a great loss of plant and animal life. The Permian–Triassic extinction event , 251 million years ago, was the worst; vertebrate recovery took 30 million years. Human activities have led to an ongoing biodiversity loss and an accompanying loss of genetic diversity . This process is often referred to as Holocene extinction , or the sixth mass extinction .

This anthropogenic extinction may have started toward the end of the Pleistocene , as some studies suggest that the megafaunal extinction event that took place around the end of the last ice age partly resulted from overhunting . [ 7 ] Biologists most often define biodiversity as the \"totality of genes , species and ecosystems of a region\". [ 8 ] [ 9 ] An advantage of this definition is that it presents a unified view of the traditional types of biological variety previously identified: Biodiversity is most commonly used to replace the more clearly-defined and long-established terms, species diversity and species richness . [ 13 ] However, there is no concrete definition for biodiversity, as its definition continues to be reimagined and redefined. To give a couple of examples, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) defined biodiversity in 2019 as \"the variability that exists among living organisms (both within and between species) and the ecosystems of which they are part.\" The World Health Organization updated its website's definition of biodiversity to be the \"variability among living organisms from all sources.\" [ 14 ] Both these definitions, although broad, give a current understanding of what is meant by the term biodiversity. According to estimates by Mora et al. (2011), there are approximately 8.7 million terrestrial species and 2.2 million oceanic species. The authors note that these estimates are strongest for eukaryotic organisms and likely represent the lower bound of prokaryotic diversity. ["

Of that number, 39% accounts for the terrestrial wildlife gone, 39% for the marine wildlife gone and 76% for the freshwater wildlife gone. Biodiversity took the biggest hit in Latin America , plummeting 83 percent. High-income countries showed a 10% increase in biodiversity, which was canceled out by a loss in low-income countries. This is despite the fact that high-income countries use five times the ecological resources of low-income countries, which was explained as a result of a process whereby wealthy nations are outsourcing resource depletion to poorer nations, which are suffering the greatest ecosystem losses.

Since the Stone Age , species loss has accelerated above the average basal rate, driven by human activity. Estimates of species losses are at a rate 100–10,000 times as fast as is typical in the fossil record.

Species today are being wiped out at a rate 100 to 1,000 times higher than baseline, and the rate of extinctions is increasing. This process destroys the resilience and adaptability of life on Earth.

About 60 percent of all vascular plants are found in tropical forests. Mangroves provide breeding grounds and nurseries for numerous species of fish and shellfish and help trap sediments that might otherwise adversely affect seagrass beds and coral reefs, which are habitats for many more marine species.

Gilbert White succinctly observed of his Selborne, Hampshire \"all nature is so full, that that district produces the most variety which is the most examined.\" [ 103 ] Biodiversity is the result of 3.5 billion years of evolution . [ 104 ] The origin of life has not been established by science, however, some evidence suggests that life may already have been well-established only a few hundred million years after the formation of the Earth . Until approximately 2.5 billion years ago, all life consisted of microorganisms – archaea , bacteria , and single-celled protozoans and protists . [ 79 ] Biodiversity grew fast during the Phanerozoic (the last 540 million years), especially during the so-called Cambrian explosion —a period during which nearly every phylum of multicellular organisms first appeared. [ 106 ] However, recent studies suggest that this diversification had started earlier, at least in the Ediacaran , and that it continued in the Ordovician . [ 107 ] Over the next 400 million years or so, invertebrate diversity showed little overall trend and vertebrate diversity shows an overall exponential trend. [ 10 ] This dramatic rise in diversity was marked by periodic, massive losses of diversity classified as mass extinction events. [ 10 ] A significant loss occurred in anamniotic limbed vertebrates when rainforests collapsed in the Carboniferous , [ 108 ] but amniotes seem to have been little affected by this event; their diversification slowed down later, around the Asselian / Sakmarian boundary, in the early Cisuralian (Early Permian ), about 293 Ma ago.

[ 112 ] The most recent major mass extinction event, the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event , occurred 66 million years ago. This period has attracted more attention than others because it resulted in the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs , which were represented by many lineages at the end of the Maastrichtian , just before that extinction event. However, many other taxa were affected by this crisis, which affected even marine taxa, such as ammonites , which also became extinct around that time. [ 113 ] The biodiversity of the past is called Paleobiodiversity. The fossil record suggests that the last few million years featured the greatest biodiversity in history . [ 10 ] However, not all scientists support this view, since there is uncertainty as to how strongly the fossil record is biased by the greater availability and preservation of recent geologic sections. [ 114 ] Some scientists believe that corrected for sampling artifacts, modern biodiversity may not be much different from biodiversity 300 million years ago, [ 106 ] whereas others consider the fossil record reasonably reflective of the diversification of life.

Many nations have laws that protect conservation-reliant species which, for example, forbid hunting or harvesting , restrict land development , or create protected areas .

[ 11 ] When discussing the IUCN Red List, the official term \" threatened \" is a grouping of three categories: critically endangered, endangered, and vulnerable. Over 50% of the world's species are estimated to be at risk of extinction, [ 12 ] but the frontiers between categories such as \"endangered\", \"rare\", or \"locally extinct\" species are often difficult to draw given the general paucity of data on most of these species. This is notably the case in the world's oceans, where distances are vast and endangered species not seen for decades may go extinct unnoticed. Internationally, 195 countries have signed an accord to create Biodiversity Action Plans that will protect endangered and other threatened species. In the United States, such plans are usually called Species Recovery Plans . [ citation needed ] Though labeled a list, the IUCN Red List is a system of assessing the global conservation status of species that includes \"Data Deficient\" (DD) species – species for which more data and assessment is required before their situation may be determined – as well species comprehensively assessed by the IUCN's species assessment process. [ 14 ] The species under the index include: mammals, birds, amphibians, cycads, and corals.

According to the US National Park Service : [ 24 ] If we can sufficiently reduce greenhouse gas emissions, many of them will still have a chance to survive and recover. NASA scientist James Hanson has warned that in order to maintain a climate similar to that under which human civilization developed and similar to that which so many organisms are adapted, we need to quickly reduce the carbon dioxide in our atmosphere to 350 parts per million (ppm). Before the industrial revolution, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels rarely rose above 280 ppm; during the 2014 calendar year, carbon dioxide levels fluctuated between 395 and 402 ppm. Under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 in the United States, species may be listed as \"endangered\" or \"threatened\". The Salt Creek tiger beetle is an example of an endangered subspecies protected under the ESA. The US Fish and Wildlife Service , as well as the National Marine Fisheries Service are held responsible for classifying and protecting endangered species. They are also responsible for adding a particular species to the list, which can be a long, controversial process.

[ 26 ] Some endangered species laws are controversial. Typical areas of controversy include criteria for placing a species on the endangered species list and rules for removing a species from the list once its population has recovered. Whether restrictions on land development constitute a \"taking\" of land by the government; the related question of whether private landowners should be compensated for the loss of uses of their areas; and obtaining reasonable exceptions to protection laws. Also lobbying from hunters and various industries like the petroleum industry , construction industry, and logging , has been an obstacle in establishing endangered species laws. The Bush administration lifted a policy that required federal officials to consult a wildlife expert before taking actions that could damage endangered species. Under the Obama administration , this policy was reinstated. [ 27 ] Being listed as an endangered species can have an indirect negative effect since the perceived increase in rarity could make a species more desirable for collectors and poachers. [ 28 ] This effect is potentially reducible, such as in China where commercially farmed turtles may be reducing some of the pressure to poach endangered species. [ 29 ] Another problem with the listing of species is its effect of inciting the use of the \"shoot, shovel, and shut-up\" method of clearing endangered species from an area of land.

Thus removing the problem from their land, but at the same time further reducing the population of an endangered species. [ 30 ] The effectiveness of the ESA– which coined the term \"endangered species\"– has been questioned by business advocacy groups and their publications but is nevertheless widely recognized by wildlife scientists who work with the species as an effective recovery tool. Nineteen species have been delisted and recovered [ 31 ] and 93% of listed species in the north eastern United States have a recovering or stable population.

Large whales like the blue whale , bowhead whale , finback whale , gray whale , sperm whale , and humpback whale are some of the eight whales which are currently still included on the Endangered Species List. Actions have been taken to attempt a reduction in whaling and increase population sizes.

Endangered species are addressed through Canada's Species at Risk Act . A species is deemed threatened or endangered when it is on the verge of extinction or extirpation . Once a species is deemed threatened or endangered, the Act requires that a recovery plan to be developed that indicates how to stop or reverse the species' population decline. [ 36 ] As of 2024, there are 339 Canadian species classified as endangered by the IUCN Red List. [ 37 ] The World Wide Fund-India raises concern in the longevity of the following animal species: the Red Panda , the Bengal Tiger , the Ganges River Dolphin , the Asian Elephant . [ 38 ] India has had significantly high rates of poaching and animal trafficking, threatening many animal species there. Since 1987, over half of trafficked tiger seizures have been within India. The government signed the Wildlife Protection Act and also joined the Convention on the International Trade in 1976, to prevent poaching from harming its wildlife.

New species may also carry diseases to which the native species have no exposure or resistance. The continent of Oceania is under much more pressure, as the invasive birds and mammals there have no natural predators. [ 40 ] Notably, the threat posed by introduces species may be greater than anticipated due to the threats on endangered species that have not yet had a significant effect, but likely will in the future. [ 41 ] The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) emphasizes that our planet is warming at a rate faster than any time in the past 10,000 years, necessitating species to adapt to new climate patterns, such as variations in rainfall and longer, warmer summers. [ 42 ] For example, the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service highlighted efforts to understand and mitigate the impact of climate change on species through scientific research, modeling, and conservation actions. This includes evaluating the current condition of species, their genetic variation, and how changes in their environment may affect their survival.

[ 44 ] In addition, climate change can lead to species decreasing in areas where they once thrived, by being forced to migrate or even going extinct from inhospitable conditions, invasive species, and fragmentation. A study cited by WWF found that one in six species is at risk of extinction due to climate change if no action is taken. The phenomenon of species shifting their ranges in response to changing climates, finding new or shrinking habitats, illustrates the direct impact of global warming on biodiversity. [ 42 ] Another major concern is rising ocean acidity caused from excess CO 2 in the atmosphere. This creates acidic conditions in the ocean which creates an inhospitable environment for fish, plants, and other keystone species such as coral reefs [ 45 ] For example, the Emperor Penguins , which rely on Antarctic sea ice for breeding, shelter, and food, are directly threatened by the melting of ice sheets. Similarly, the Mount Rainier white-tailed ptarmigan , adapted to alpine mountaintops, faces habitat loss due to climate changes in snowfall patterns and rising temperatures. [ 46 ] Another example is in the case of the Salton Sea in California. This area is a critical habitat for many endangered and watched species, as well as many migratory birds.

This not only damages air quality but also has caused fish kills to accumulate as shown pictured below. This has made the system inhospitable to the birds and endangered species relying upon it [ 47 ] Captive breeding is the process of breeding rare or endangered species in human controlled environments with restricted settings, such as wildlife reserves, zoos, and other conservation facilities. Captive breeding is meant to save species from extinction and so stabilise the population of the species that it will not disappear. [ 48 ] This technique has worked for many species for some time, with probably the oldest known such instances of captive mating being attributed to menageries of European and Asian rulers, an example being the Père David's deer . However, captive breeding techniques are usually difficult to implement for such highly mobile species as some migratory birds (e.g. cranes) and fishes (e.g. hilsa ). Additionally, if the captive breeding population is too small, then inbreeding may occur due to a reduced gene pool and reduce resistance . In 1981, the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) created a Species Survival Plan (SSP) to help preserve specific endangered and threatened species through captive breeding. With over 450 SSP Plans, some endangered species are covered by the AZA with plans to cover population management goals and recommendations for breeding for a diverse and healthy population, created by Taxon Advisory Groups.

SSP Programs regularly participate in species recovery, veterinary care for wildlife disease outbreaks, and some other wildlife conservation efforts. The AZA's Species Survival Plan also has breeding and transfer programs, both within and outside of AZA – certified zoos and aquariums. Some animals that are part of SSP programs are giant pandas , lowland gorillas, and California condors .

It has substantially increased the populations of the southern black rhinoceros and southern white rhinoceros . Richard Emslie, a scientific officer at the IUCN, said of such programs, \"Effective law enforcement has become much easier now that the animals are largely privately owned... We have been able to bring local communities into conservation programs. There are increasingly strong economic incentives attached to looking after rhinos rather than simply poaching: from Eco-tourism or selling them on for a profit.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 15 ] The concern stems from estimates suggesting that up to 50% of all species on the planet will disappear within the next 50 years, [ 16 ] which will increase poverty and starvation, and will reset the course of evolution on this planet. [ 17 ] [ 18 ] Researchers acknowledge that projections are difficult, given the unknown potential impacts of many variables, including species introduction to new biogeographical settings and a non-analog climate.

Those dedicated to the cause and profession advocate for a global response to the current biodiversity crisis based on morals , ethics , and scientific reason. Organizations and citizens are responding to the biodiversity crisis through conservation action plans that direct research, monitoring, and education programs that engage concerns at local through global scales. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] There is increasing recognition that conservation is not just about what is achieved but how it is done. [ 20 ] The conservation of natural resources is the fundamental problem. Unless we solve that problem, it will avail us little to solve all others. Conscious efforts to conserve and protect global biodiversity are a recent phenomenon. [ 7 ] [ 22 ] Natural resource conservation, however, has a history that extends prior to the age of conservation. Resource ethics grew out of necessity through direct relations with nature. Regulation or communal restraint became necessary to prevent selfish motives from taking more than could be locally sustained, therefore compromising the long-term supply for the rest of the community.

The conservation ethic that began to evolve included three core principles: that human activity damaged the environment , that there was a civic duty to maintain the environment for future generations, and that scientific, empirically based methods should be applied to ensure this duty was carried out. Sir James Ranald Martin was prominent in promoting this ideology, publishing many medico-topographical reports that demonstrated the scale of damage wrought through large-scale deforestation and desiccation, and lobbying extensively for the institutionalization of forest conservation activities in British India through the establishment of Forest Departments .

Considerable research effort is now directed at urban conservation biology. The Society for Conservation Biology originated in 1985.

Estimates vary greatly on how many species actually exist (estimated range: 3,600,000–111,700,000) [ 77 ] to how many have received a species binomial (estimated range: 1.5–8 million).

Oceanographers draw upon a wide range of disciplines to deepen their understanding of the world’s oceans, incorporating insights from astronomy , biology , chemistry , geography , geology , hydrology , meteorology and physics . Humans first acquired knowledge of the waves and currents of the seas and oceans in pre-historic times. Observations on tides were recorded by Aristotle and Strabo in 384–322 BC.

The Portuguese campaign of Atlantic navigation is the earliest example of a systematic scientific large project, sustained over many decades, studying the currents and winds of the Atlantic.

[ 2 ] The main problem in navigating back from the south of the Canary Islands (or south of Boujdour ) by sail alone, is due to the change in the regime of winds and currents: the North Atlantic gyre and the Equatorial counter current [ 5 ] will push south along the northwest bulge of Africa, while the uncertain winds where the Northeast trades meet the Southeast trades (the doldrums) [ 6 ] leave a sailing ship to the mercy of the currents.

The return route from regions south of the Canaries became the ' volta do largo' or 'volta do mar '. The 'rediscovery' of the Azores islands in 1427 is merely a reflection of the heightened strategic importance of the islands, now sitting on the return route from the western coast of Africa (sequentially called 'volta de Guiné' and 'volta da Mina'); and the references to the Sargasso Sea (also called at the time 'Mar da Baga'), to the west of the Azores , in 1436, reveals the western extent of the return route. [ 7 ] This is necessary, under sail, to make use of the southeasterly and northeasterly winds away from the western coast of Africa, up to the northern latitudes where the westerly winds will bring the seafarers towards the western coasts of Europe.

The Danish expedition to Arabia 1761–67 can be said to be the world's first oceanographic expedition, as the ship Grønland had on board a group of scientists, including naturalist Peter Forsskål , who was assigned an explicit task by the king, Frederik V , to study and describe the marine life in the open sea, including finding the cause of mareel , or milky seas. For this purpose, the expedition was equipped with nets and scrapers, specifically designed to collect samples from the open waters and the bottom at great depth. [ 12 ] Although Juan Ponce de León in 1513 first identified the Gulf Stream , and the current was well known to mariners, Benjamin Franklin made the first scientific study of it and gave it its name. Franklin measured water temperatures during several Atlantic crossings and correctly explained the Gulf Stream's cause. Franklin and Timothy Folger printed the first map of the Gulf Stream in 1769–1770.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] Information on the currents of the Pacific Ocean was gathered by explorers of the late 18th century, including James Cook and Louis Antoine de Bougainville . James Rennell wrote the first scientific textbooks on oceanography, detailing the current flows of the Atlantic and Indian oceans. During a voyage around the Cape of Good Hope in 1777, he mapped \"the banks and currents at the Lagullas \" . He was also the first to understand the nature of the intermittent current near the Isles of Scilly , (now known as Rennell's Current). [ 15 ] The tides and currents of the ocean are distinct. Tides are the rise and fall of sea levels created by the combination of the gravitational forces of the Moon along with the Sun (the Sun just in a much lesser extent) and are also caused by the Earth and Moon orbiting each other. An ocean current is a continuous, directed movement of seawater generated by a number of forces acting upon the water, including wind, the Coriolis effect , breaking waves , cabbeling , and temperature and salinity differences . [ 16 ] Sir James Clark Ross took the first modern sounding in deep sea in 1840, and Charles Darwin published a paper on reefs and the formation of atolls as a result of the second voyage of HMS Beagle in 1831–1836.

His 1855 textbook Physical Geography of the Sea was one of the first comprehensive oceanography studies. Many nations sent oceanographic observations to Maury at the Naval Observatory, where he and his colleagues evaluated the information and distributed the results worldwide. [ 17 ] Knowledge of the oceans remained confined to the topmost few fathoms of the water and a small amount of the bottom, mainly in shallow areas. Almost nothing was known of the ocean depths. The British Royal Navy 's efforts to chart all of the world's coastlines in the mid-19th century reinforced the vague idea that most of the ocean was very deep, although little more was known. As exploration ignited both popular and scientific interest in the polar regions and Africa , so too did the mysteries of the unexplored oceans. The seminal event in the founding of the modern science of oceanography was the 1872–1876 Challenger expedition . As the first true oceanographic cruise, this expedition laid the groundwork for an entire academic and research discipline. [ 18 ] In response to a recommendation from the Royal Society , the British Government announced in 1871 an expedition to explore world's oceans and conduct appropriate scientific investigation. Charles Wyville Thomson and Sir John Murray launched the Challenger expedition .

On her journey circumnavigating the globe, [ 19 ] 492 deep sea soundings, 133 bottom dredges, 151 open water trawls and 263 serial water temperature observations were taken. [ 20 ] Around 4,700 new species of marine life were discovered. The result was the Report Of The Scientific Results of the Exploring Voyage of H.M.S. Challenger during the years 1873–76 . Murray, who supervised the publication, described the report as \"the greatest advance in the knowledge of our planet since the celebrated discoveries of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries\". He went on to found the academic discipline of oceanography at the University of Edinburgh , which remained the centre for oceanographic research well into the 20th century. [ 21 ] Murray was the first to study marine trenches and in particular the Mid-Atlantic Ridge , and map the sedimentary deposits in the oceans. He tried to map out the world's ocean currents based on salinity and temperature observations, and was the first to correctly understand the nature of coral reef development. In the late 19th century, other Western nations also sent out scientific expeditions (as did private individuals and institutions).

The Sea (in three volumes, covering physical oceanography, seawater and geology) edited by M.N.

The Great Global Rift, running along the Mid Atlantic Ridge, was discovered by Maurice Ewing and Bruce Heezen in 1953 and mapped by Heezen and Marie Tharp using bathymetric data; in 1954 a mountain range under the Arctic Ocean was found by the Arctic Institute of the USSR. The theory of seafloor spreading was developed in 1960 by Harry Hammond Hess . The Ocean Drilling Program started in 1966.

Early techniques included analog computers (such as the Ishiguro Storm Surge Computer ) generally now replaced by numerical methods (e.g. SLOSH .) An oceanographic buoy array was established in the Pacific to allow prediction of El Niño events. 1990 saw the start of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) which continued until 2002. Geosat seafloor mapping data became available in 1995. Study of the oceans is critical to understanding shifts in Earth's energy balance along with related global and regional changes in climate , the biosphere and biogeochemistry . The atmosphere and ocean are linked because of evaporation and precipitation as well as thermal flux (and solar insolation ). Recent studies have advanced knowledge on ocean acidification , ocean heat content , ocean currents , sea level rise , the oceanic carbon cycle , the water cycle , Arctic sea ice decline , coral bleaching , marine heatwaves , extreme weather , coastal erosion and many other phenomena in regards to ongoing climate change and climate feedbacks .

Chemical oceanography is the study of the chemistry of the ocean. Whereas chemical oceanography is primarily occupied with the study and understanding of seawater properties and its changes, ocean chemistry focuses primarily on the geochemical cycles . The following is a central topic investigated by chemical oceanography. Ocean acidification describes the decrease in ocean pH that is caused by anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions into the atmosphere . [ 31 ] Seawater is slightly alkaline and had a preindustrial pH of about 8.2. More recently, anthropogenic activities have steadily increased the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere; about 30–40% of the added CO 2 is absorbed by the oceans, forming carbonic acid and lowering the pH (now below 8.1 [ 32 ] ) through ocean acidification. [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] The pH is expected to reach 7.7 by the year 2100. [ 36 ] An important element for the skeletons of marine animals is calcium , but calcium carbonate becomes more soluble with pressure, so carbonate shells and skeletons dissolve below the carbonate compensation depth . [ 37 ] Calcium carbonate becomes more soluble at lower pH, so ocean acidification is likely to affect marine organisms with calcareous shells, such as oysters, clams, sea urchins and corals, [ 38 ] [ 39 ] and the carbonate compensation depth will rise closer to the sea surface."

Affected planktonic organisms will include pteropods , coccolithophorids and foraminifera , all important in the food chain . In tropical regions, corals are likely to be severely affected as they become less able to build their calcium carbonate skeletons, [ 40 ] in turn adversely impacting other reef dwellers. [ 36 ] The current rate of ocean chemistry change seems to be unprecedented in Earth's geological history, making it unclear how well marine ecosystems will adapt to the shifting conditions of the near future. [ 41 ] Of particular concern is the manner in which the combination of acidification with the expected additional stressors of higher ocean temperatures and lower oxygen levels will impact the seas.

Physical oceanography studies the ocean's physical attributes including temperature-salinity structure, mixing, surface waves , internal waves, surface tides , internal tides , and currents . The following are central topics investigated by physical oceanography. Since the early ocean expeditions in oceanography, a major interest was the study of ocean currents and temperature measurements.

A large proportion of all life on Earth lives in the ocean. The exact size of this \"large proportion\" is unknown, since many ocean species are still to be discovered. The ocean is a complex three-dimensional world, [ 1 ] covering approximately 71% of the Earth's surface. The habitats studied in marine biology include everything from the tiny layers of surface water in which organisms and abiotic items may be trapped in surface tension between the ocean and atmosphere, to the depths of the oceanic trenches , sometimes 10,000 meters or more beneath the surface of the ocean. Specific habitats include estuaries , coral reefs , kelp forests , seagrass meadows , the surrounds of seamounts and thermal vents , tidepools , muddy, sandy and rocky bottoms, and the open ocean ( pelagic ) zone, where solid objects are rare and the surface of the water is the only visible boundary. The organisms studied range from microscopic phytoplankton and zooplankton to huge cetaceans (whales) 25–32 meters (82–105 feet) in length.

Most marine life is found in coastal habitats, even though the shelf area occupies only seven percent of the total ocean area. Open ocean habitats are found in the deep ocean beyond the edge of the continental shelf. Alternatively, marine habitats can be divided into pelagic and demersal habitats.

Shore habitats span from the upper intertidal zones to the area where land vegetation takes prominence. It can be underwater anywhere from daily to very infrequently. Many species here are scavengers, living off of sea life that is washed up on the shore. Many land animals also make much use of the shore and intertidal habitats. A subgroup of organisms in this habitat bores and grinds exposed rock through the process of bioerosion . Estuaries are also near shore and influenced by the tides . An estuary is a partially enclosed coastal body of water with one or more rivers or streams flowing into it and with a free connection to the open sea. [ 10 ] Estuaries form a transition zone between freshwater river environments and saltwater maritime environments. They are subject both to marine influences—such as tides, waves, and the influx of saline water—and to riverine influences—such as flows of fresh water and sediment. The shifting flows of both sea water and fresh water provide high levels of nutrients both in the water column and in sediment, making estuaries among the most productive natural habitats in the world.

Reefs can also grow on other surfaces, which has made it possible to create artificial reefs . Coral reefs also support a huge community of life, including the corals themselves, their symbiotic zooxanthellae , tropical fish and many other organisms. Much attention in marine biology is focused on coral reefs and the El Niño weather phenomenon. In 1998, coral reefs experienced the most severe mass bleaching events on record, when vast expanses of reefs across the world died because sea surface temperatures rose well above normal.

At such depths, water pressure is extreme and there is no sunlight, but some life still exists. A white flatfish , a shrimp and a jellyfish were seen by the crew of the bathyscaphe Trieste when it dove to the bottom in 1960, which led to scientific debate surrounding the likelihood of bony fish surviving in such deep waters. General scientific consensus has discredited the possible viewing of a flatfish at such depths.

Marine biology classifies species based on their environment rather than their taxonomy. For this reason, marine biology encompasses not only organisms that live only in a marine environment, but also other organisms whose lives revolve around the sea. As inhabitants of the largest environment on Earth, microbial marine systems drive changes in every global system. Microbes are responsible for virtually all photosynthesis that occurs in the ocean, as well as the cycling of carbon , nitrogen , phosphorus and other nutrients and trace elements. [ 26 ] Microscopic life undersea is incredibly diverse and still poorly understood. For example, the role of viruses in marine ecosystems is barely being explored even in the beginning of the 21st century. [ 27 ] The role of phytoplankton is better understood due to their critical position as the most numerous primary producers on Earth. Phytoplankton are categorized into cyanobacteria (also called blue-green algae/bacteria), various types of algae (red, green, brown, and yellow-green), diatoms , dinoflagellates , euglenoids , coccolithophorids , cryptomonads , chrysophytes , chlorophytes , prasinophytes , and silicoflagellates .

Microscopic algae and plants provide important habitats for life, sometimes acting as hiding places for larval forms of larger fish and foraging places for invertebrates. Algal life is widespread and very diverse under the ocean. Microscopic photosynthetic algae contribute a larger proportion of the world's photosynthetic output than all the terrestrial forests combined. Most of the niche occupied by sub plants on land is actually occupied by macroscopic algae in the ocean, such as Sargassum and kelp , which are commonly known as seaweeds that create kelp forests . Plants that survive in the sea are often found in shallow waters, such as the seagrasses (examples of which are eelgrass, Zostera , and turtle grass, Thalassia ). These plants have adapted to the high salinity of the ocean environment. The intertidal zone is also a good place to find plant life in the sea, where mangroves or cordgrass or beach grass might grow. As on land, invertebrates , or animals that lack a backbone, make up a huge portion of all life in the sea. Invertebrate sea life includes Cnidaria such as jellyfish and sea anemones ; Ctenophora ; sea worms including the phyla Platyhelminthes , Nemertea , Annelida , Sipuncula , Echiura , Chaetognatha , and Phoronida ; Mollusca including shellfish , squid , octopus ; Arthropoda including Chelicerata and Crustacea ; Porifera"

Over 10,000 [ 28 ] species of fungi are known from marine environments. [ 29 ] These are parasitic on marine algae or animals, or are saprobes on algae, corals, protozoan cysts, sea grasses, wood and other substrata, and can also be found in sea foam . [ 30 ] Spores of many species have special appendages which facilitate attachment to the substratum. [ 31 ] A very diverse range of unusual secondary metabolites is produced by marine fungi. [ 32 ] A reported 33,400 species of fish , including bony and cartilaginous fish , had been described by 2016, [ 33 ] more than all other vertebrates combined. About 60% of fish species live in saltwater. [ 34 ] Reptiles which inhabit or frequent the sea include sea turtles , sea snakes , terrapins , the marine iguana , and the saltwater crocodile . Most extant marine reptiles, except for some sea snakes, are oviparous and need to return to land to lay their eggs. Thus most species, excluding sea turtles, spend most of their lives on or near land rather than in the ocean. Despite their marine adaptations, most sea snakes prefer shallow waters nearby land, around islands, especially waters that are somewhat sheltered, as well as near estuaries.

Birds adapted to living in the marine environment are often called seabirds . Examples include albatross , penguins , gannets , and auks . Although they spend most of their lives in the ocean, species such as gulls can often be found thousands of miles inland. There are five main types of marine mammals: cetaceans ( toothed whales and baleen whales ); sirenians such as manatees ; pinnipeds including seals and the walrus ; sea otters ; and the polar bear . All are air-breathing, meaning that while some such as the sperm whale can dive for prolonged periods, all must return to the surface to breathe. [ 37 ] [ 38 ] The marine ecosystem is large, and thus there are many sub-fields of marine biology. Most involve studying specializations of particular animal groups, such as phycology , invertebrate zoology and ichthyology . Other subfields study the physical effects of continual immersion in sea water and the ocean in general, adaptation to a salty environment, and the effects of changing various oceanic properties on marine life. A subfield of marine biology studies the relationships between oceans and ocean life, and global warming and environmental issues (such as carbon dioxide displacement).

Through constant monitoring of the ocean, there have been discoveries of marine life which could be used to create remedies for certain diseases such as cancer and leukemia. In addition, Ziconotide, an approved drug used to treat pain, was created from a snail which resides in the ocean. [ 39 ] Marine biology is a branch of biology . It is closely linked to oceanography , especially biological oceanography , and may be regarded as a sub-field of marine science . It also encompasses many ideas from ecology . Fisheries science and marine conservation can be considered partial offshoots of marine biology (as well as environmental studies ). Marine chemistry , physical oceanography and atmospheric sciences are also closely related to this field. An active research topic in marine biology is to discover and map the life cycles of various species and where they spend their time. Technologies that aid in this discovery include pop-up satellite archival tags , acoustic tags , and a variety of other data loggers . Marine biologists study how the ocean currents , tides and many other oceanic factors affect ocean life forms, including their growth, distribution and well-being. This has only recently become technically feasible with advances in GPS and newer underwater visual devices.

For example, it is still largely unknown where juvenile sea turtles and some sharks in the first year of their life travel. Recent advances in underwater tracking devices are illuminating what we know about marine organisms that live at great ocean depths. [ 41 ] The information that pop-up satellite archival tags gives aids in fishing closures for certain times of the year and the development of marine protected areas . This data is important to both scientists and fishermen because they are discovering that, by restricting commercial fishing in one small area, they can have a large impact in maintaining a healthy fish population in a much larger area. The study of marine biology dates to Aristotle (384–322 BC), who made many observations of life in the sea around Lesbos , laying the foundation for many future discoveries. [ 43 ] In 1768, Samuel Gottlieb Gmelin (1744–1774) published the Historia Fucorum , the first work dedicated to marine algae and the first book on marine biology to use the new binomial nomenclature of Linnaeus . It included elaborate illustrations of seaweed and marine algae on folded leaves.

The observations made in the first studies of marine biology fueled the Age of Discovery and exploration that followed. During this time, a vast amount of knowledge was gained about the life that exists in the oceans of the world. Many voyages contributed significantly to this pool of knowledge. Among the most significant were the voyages of HMS Beagle where Charles Darwin came up with his theories of evolution and on the formation of coral reefs . [ 47 ] Another important expedition was undertaken by HMS Challenger , where findings were made of unexpectedly high species diversity among fauna stimulating much theorizing by population ecologists on how such varieties of life could be maintained in what was thought to be such a hostile environment. [ 48 ] This era was important for the history of marine biology but naturalists were still limited in their studies because they lacked technology that would allow them to adequately examine species that lived in deep parts of the oceans. The creation of marine laboratories was important because it allowed marine biologists to conduct research and process their specimens from expeditions. The oldest marine laboratory in the world, Station biologique de Roscoff , was established in Concarneau, France founded by the College of France in 1859.

The Arctic region, from the IERS Reference Meridian travelling east, consists of parts of northern Norway ( Nordland , Troms , Finnmark , Svalbard and Jan Mayen ), northernmost Sweden ( Västerbotten , Norrbotten and Lappland ), northern Finland ( North Ostrobothnia , Kainuu and Lappi ), Russia ( Murmansk , Siberia , Nenets Okrug , Novaya Zemlya ), the United States ( Alaska ), Canada ( Yukon , Northwest Territories , Nunavut ), Danish Realm ( Greenland ), and northern Iceland ( Grímsey and Kolbeinsey ), along with the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas. Land within the Arctic region has seasonally varying snow and ice cover , with predominantly treeless permafrost under the tundra . Arctic seas contain seasonal sea ice in many places. The Arctic region is a unique area among Earth's ecosystems. The cultures in the region and the Arctic indigenous peoples have adapted to its cold and extreme conditions. Life in the Arctic includes zooplankton and phytoplankton , fish and marine mammals , birds, land animals, plants, and human societies. [ 3 ] Arctic land is bordered by the subarctic .

[ 7 ] There are several definitions of what area is contained within the Arctic. The area can be defined as north of the Arctic Circle (about 66° 34'N), the approximate southern limit of the midnight sun and the polar night . Another definition of the Arctic, which is popular with ecologists , is the region in the Northern Hemisphere where the average temperature for the warmest month (July) is below 10 °C (50 °F); the northernmost tree line roughly follows the isotherm at the boundary of this region. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] The climate of the Arctic region is characterized by cold winters and cool summers. Its precipitation mostly comes in the form of snow and is low, with most of the area receiving less than 50 cm (20 in). High winds often stir up snow, creating the illusion of continuous snowfall. Average winter temperatures can go as low as −40 °C (−40 °F), and the coldest recorded temperature is approximately −68 °C (−90 °F). Coastal Arctic climates are moderated by oceanic influences, having generally warmer temperatures and heavier snowfalls than the colder and drier interior areas. The Arctic is affected by current global warming , leading to climate change in the Arctic , including Arctic sea ice decline , diminished ice in the Greenland ice sheet , and Arctic methane emissions as the permafrost thaws.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] The melting of Greenland's ice sheet is linked to polar amplification . [ 12 ] Due to the poleward migration of the planet's isotherms (about 56 km (35 mi) per decade during the past 30 years as a consequence of global warming), the Arctic region (as defined by tree line and temperature) is currently shrinking. [ 13 ] Perhaps the most alarming result of this is Arctic sea ice shrinkage. There is a large variance in predictions of Arctic sea ice loss, with models showing near-complete to complete loss in September from 2035 to sometime around 2067. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Arctic life is characterized by adaptation to short growing seasons with long periods of sunlight, and cold, dark, snow-covered winter conditions. Arctic vegetation is composed of plants such as dwarf shrubs , graminoids , herbs , lichens , and mosses , which all grow relatively close to the ground, forming tundra . An example of a dwarf shrub is the bearberry . As one moves northward, the amount of warmth available for plant growth decreases considerably. In the northernmost areas, plants are at their metabolic limits, and small differences in the total amount of summer warmth make large differences in the amount of energy available for maintenance, growth, and reproduction.

In the coldest parts of the Arctic, much of the ground is bare; non-vascular plants such as lichens and mosses predominate, along with a few scattered grasses and forbs (like the Arctic poppy ). Herbivores on the tundra include the Arctic hare , lemming , muskox , and reindeer (caribou). They are preyed on by the snowy owl , Arctic fox , grizzly bear , and Arctic wolf . The polar bear is also a predator, though it prefers to hunt for marine life from the ice. There are also many birds and marine species endemic to the colder regions. Other terrestrial animals include wolverines , moose , Dall sheep , ermines , and Arctic ground squirrels . Marine mammals include seals , walruses , and several species of cetacean — baleen whales and also narwhals , orcas , and belugas .

The Arctic also holds 1/5 of the Earth's water supply. [ 16 ] During the Cretaceous period , the Arctic still had seasonal snows, though only a light dusting and not enough to permanently hinder plant growth. Animals such as the Chasmosaurus , Hypacrosaurus , Troodon , and Edmontosaurus may have all migrated north to take advantage of the summer growing season, and migrated south to warmer climes when winter came. A similar situation may also have been found amongst dinosaurs that lived in Antarctic regions, such as the Muttaburrasaurus of Australia. However, others claim that dinosaurs lived year-round at very high latitudes, such as near the Colville River , which is now at about 70° N but at the time (70 million years ago) was 10° further north. [ 17 ] The earliest inhabitants of North America's central and eastern Arctic are referred to as the Arctic small tool tradition (AST) and existed c. 2500 BCE .

Scientists theorize that there may have been cross-contact between the two cultures with the sharing of technology, such as fashioning harpoon heads, or the Thule may have found Dorset remnants and adapted their ways with the predecessor culture. [ 22 ] The evidence suggested that Inuit descend from the Birnirk of Siberia, through the Thule culture expanded into northern Canada and Greenland, where they genetically and culturally completely replaced the Indigenous Dorset people sometime after 1300 CE.

Most recently a group of states [ clarification needed ] at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development , on 21 June 2012, proposed protecting the Arctic, similar to the Antarctic Treaty System . The initial focus of the campaign will be a UN resolution creating a global sanctuary around the pole, and a ban on oil drilling and unsustainable fishing in the Arctic. [ 45 ] The Arctic has climate change rates that are amongst the highest in the world. Due to the major impacts to the region from climate change the near climate future of the region will be extremely different under all scenarios of warming. [ 46 ] The effects of climate change in the Arctic include rising temperatures, loss of sea ice , and melting of the Greenland ice sheet . The Arctic near-surface temperature is increasing at a rate that is 2–3 times faster than the global average, which is referred to as Arctic amplification. [ 49 ] Potential methane release from the region, especially through the thawing of permafrost and methane clathrates , is also a concern.

The melting of Greenland's ice sheet is linked to polar amplification. [ 51 ] [ 52 ] The Arctic region is especially vulnerable to the effects of any climate change , as has become apparent with the reduction of sea ice in recent years. Climate models predict much greater climate change in the Arctic than the global average, [ 53 ] resulting in significant international attention to the region. In particular, there are concerns that Arctic shrinkage, a consequence of melting glaciers and other ice in Greenland, could soon contribute to a substantial rise in sea levels worldwide. [ 54 ] The current Arctic warming is leading to ancient carbon being released from thawing permafrost , leading to methane and carbon dioxide production by micro-organisms. [ 55 ] [ 56 ] Release of methane and carbon dioxide stored in permafrost could cause abrupt and severe global warming, [ 57 ] as they are potent greenhouse gases . [ 58 ] Climate change is also predicted to have a large impact on tundra vegetation, causing an increase of shrubs, [ 60 ] and having a negative impact on bryophytes and lichens. [ 61 ] Apart from concerns regarding the detrimental effects of warming in the Arctic, some potential opportunities have gained attention.

About 84% of the total rainfall occurs in the monsoon from June to September. Consequently, streamflow in the Ganges is highly seasonal. The average dry season to monsoon discharge ratio is about 1:6, as measured at Hardinge Bridge . This strong seasonal variation underlies many problems of land and water resource development in the region. [ 44 ] The seasonality of flow is so acute it can cause both drought and floods . Bangladesh, in particular, frequently experiences drought during the dry season and regularly suffers extreme floods during the monsoon. [ 58 ] In the Ganges Delta, many large rivers come together, both merging and bifurcating in a complicated network of channels . The two largest rivers, the Ganges and Brahmaputra, both split into distributary channels, the largest of which merge with other large rivers before themselves joining the Bay of Bengal. But this current channel pattern was not always the case. Over time the rivers in Ganges Delta have often changed course , sometimes altering the network of channels in significant ways.

Between the 12th and 16th centuries, the Bhagirathi-Hooghly and Padma channels were more or less equally significant. After the 16th century, the Padma grew to become the main channel of the Ganges.

By the end of the 18th century, the Padma had become the main distributary of the Ganges. [ 32 ] One result of this shift to the Padma was that the Ganges now joined the Meghna and Brahmaputra rivers before emptying into the Bay of Bengal. The present confluence of the Ganges and Meghna was formed very recently, about 150 years ago. [ 60 ] Also near the end of the 18th century, the course of the lower Brahmaputra changed dramatically, significantly altering its relationship with the Ganges. In 1787 there was a great flood on the Teesta River , which at the time was a tributary of the Ganges-Padma River. The flood of 1787 caused the Teesta to undergo a sudden change course, an avulsion , shifting east to join the Brahmaputra and causing the Brahmaputra to shift its course south, cutting a new channel. This new main channel of the Brahmaputra is called the Jamuna River. It flows south to join the Ganges-Padma. During ancient times, the main flow of the Brahmaputra"

During ancient times, the main flow of the Brahmaputra was more easterly, passing by the city of Mymensingh and joining the Meghna River. Today this channel is a small distributary but retains the name Brahmaputra, sometimes Old Brahmaputra. [ 61 ] The site of the old Brahmaputra-Meghna confluence, in the locality of Langalbandh , is still considered sacred by Hindus. Near the confluence is a major early historic site called Wari-Bateshwar . [ 62 ] In the rainy season of 1809, the lower channel of the Bhagirathi, leading to Kolkata, had been entirely shut; but in the following year it opened again and was nearly of the same size as the upper channel but both however suffered a considerable diminution, owing probably to the new communication opened below the Jalanggi on the upper channel.

[ 3 ] This was later revised and renamed the local magnitude scale , denoted as ML or M L . [ 4 ] Because of various shortcomings of the original M L scale, most seismological authorities now use other similar scales such as the moment magnitude scale (M w ) to report earthquake magnitudes, but much of the news media still erroneously refers to these as \"Richter\" magnitudes. All magnitude scales retain the logarithmic character of the original and are scaled to have roughly comparable numeric values (typically in the middle of the scale). Due to the variance in earthquakes, it is essential to understand the Richter scale uses common logarithms simply to make the measurements manageable (i.e., a magnitude 3 quake factors 10³ while a magnitude 5 quake factors 10 5 and has seismometer readings 100 times larger). [ 5 ] The Richter magnitude of an earthquake is determined from the logarithm of the amplitude of waves recorded by seismographs. Adjustments are included to compensate for the variation in the distance between the various seismographs and the epicenter of the earthquake. The original formula is: [ 6 ] where A is the maximum excursion of the Wood-Anderson seismograph , the empirical function A 0 depends only on the epicentral distance of the station, δ {\\displaystyle \\delta } .

[ 6 ] Because of the logarithmic basis of the scale, each whole number increase in magnitude represents a tenfold increase in measured amplitude. In terms of energy, each whole number increase corresponds to an increase of about 31.6 times the amount of energy released, and each increase of 0.2 corresponds to approximately a doubling of the energy released. Events with magnitudes greater than 4.5 are strong enough to be recorded by a seismograph anywhere in the world, so long as its sensors are not located in the earthquake's shadow . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] The following describes the typical effects of earthquakes of various magnitudes near the epicenter. [ 10 ] The values are typical and may not be exact in a future event because intensity and ground effects depend not only on the magnitude but also on (1) the distance to the epicenter, (2) the depth of the earthquake's focus beneath the epicenter, (3) the location of the epicenter, and (4) geological conditions . ( Based on U.S. Geological Survey documents. ) [ 14 ] The intensity and death toll depend on several factors (earthquake depth, epicenter location, and population density, to name a few) and can vary widely.

[ 15 ] The largest recorded earthquake was the Great Chilean earthquake of May 22, 1960, which had a magnitude of 9.5 on the moment magnitude scale . [ 16 ] Seismologist Susan Hough has suggested that a magnitude 10 quake may represent a very approximate upper limit for what the Earth's tectonic zones are capable of, which would be the result of the largest known continuous belt of faults rupturing together (along the Pacific coast of the Americas). [ 17 ] A research at the Tohoku University in Japan found that a magnitude 10 earthquake was theoretically possible if a combined 3,000 kilometres (1,900 mi) of faults from the Japan Trench to the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench ruptured together and moved by 60 metres (200 ft) (or if a similar large-scale rupture occurred elsewhere). Such an earthquake would cause ground motions for up to an hour, with tsunamis hitting shores while the ground is still shaking, and if this kind of earthquake occurred, it would probably be a 1-in-10,000-year event. [ 18 ] Prior to the development of the magnitude scale, the only measure of an earthquake's strength or \"size\" was a subjective assessment of the intensity of shaking observed near the epicenter of the earthquake, categorized by various seismic intensity scales such as the Rossi–Forel scale . (\"Size\" is used in the sense of the quantity of energy released, not the size of the area affected by shaking, though higher-energy earthquakes do tend to affect a wider area, depending on the local geology.)"

In 1883, John Milne surmised that the shaking of large earthquakes might generate waves detectable around the globe, and in 1899 E. Von Rehbur Paschvitz observed in Germany seismic waves attributable to an earthquake in Tokyo . [ 19 ] In the 1920s, Harry O. Wood and John A. Anderson developed the Wood–Anderson seismograph , one of the first practical instruments for recording seismic waves. [ 20 ] Wood then built, under the auspices of the California Institute of Technology and the Carnegie Institute , a network of seismographs stretching across Southern California . [ 21 ] He also recruited the young and unknown Charles Richter to measure the seismograms and locate the earthquakes generating the seismic waves. [ 22 ] In 1931, Kiyoo Wadati showed how he had measured, for several strong earthquakes in Japan, the amplitude of the shaking observed at various distances from the epicenter. He then plotted the logarithm of the amplitude against the distance and found a series of curves that showed a rough correlation with the estimated magnitudes of the earthquakes. [ 23 ] Richter resolved some difficulties with this method [ 24 ] and then, using data collected by his colleague Beno Gutenberg , he produced similar curves, confirming that they could be used to compare the relative magnitudes of different earthquakes.

First, to span the wide range of possible values, Richter adopted Gutenberg's suggestion of a logarithmic scale, where each step represents a tenfold increase of magnitude, similar to the magnitude scale used by astronomers for star brightness . [ 26 ] Second, he wanted a magnitude of zero to be around the limit of human perceptibility. [ 27 ] Third, he specified the Wood–Anderson seismograph as the standard instrument for producing seismograms. Magnitude was then defined as \"the logarithm of the maximum trace amplitude, expressed in microns \", measured at a distance of 100 km (62 mi). The scale was calibrated by defining a magnitude 0 shock as one that produces (at a distance of 100 km (62 mi)) a maximum amplitude of 1 micron (1 μm, or 0.001 millimeters) on a seismogram recorded by a Wood-Anderson torsion seismometer. [ 28 ] Finally, Richter calculated a table of distance corrections, [ 29 ] in that for distances less than 200 kilometers [ 30 ] the attenuation is strongly affected by the structure and properties of the regional geology. [ 31 ] When Richter presented the resulting scale in 1935, he called it (at the suggestion of Harry Wood) simply a \"magnitude\" scale.

[ 4 ] The Richter scale was defined in 1935 for particular circumstances and instruments; the particular circumstances refer to it being defined for Southern California and \"implicitly incorporates the attenuative properties of Southern California crust and mantle.\" [ 34 ] The particular instrument used would become saturated by strong earthquakes and unable to record high values. The scale was replaced in the 1970s by the moment magnitude scale (MMS, symbol M w ); for earthquakes adequately measured by the Richter scale, numerical values are approximately the same. Although values measured for earthquakes now are M w , they are frequently reported by the press as Richter values, even for earthquakes of magnitude over 8, when the Richter scale becomes meaningless. The Richter and MMS scales measure the energy released by an earthquake; another scale, the Mercalli intensity scale , classifies earthquakes by their effects , from detectable by instruments but not noticeable, to catastrophic. The energy and effects are not necessarily strongly correlated; a shallow earthquake in a populated area with soil of certain types can be far more intense in impact than a much more energetic deep earthquake in an isolated area.

In addition, the body wave magnitude , mb , and the moment magnitude , M w , abbreviated MMS, have been widely used for decades. A couple of new techniques to measure magnitude are in the development stage by seismologists. All magnitude scales have been designed to give numerically similar results. This goal has been achieved well for M L , M s , and M w . [ 35 ] [ 36 ] The mb scale gives somewhat different values than the other scales. The reason for so many different ways to measure the same thing is that at different distances, for different hypocentral depths, and for different earthquake sizes, the amplitudes of different types of elastic waves must be measured. M L is the scale used for the majority of earthquakes reported (tens of thousands) by local and regional seismological observatories. For large earthquakes worldwide, the moment magnitude scale (MMS) is most common, although M s is also reported frequently. The seismic moment , M 0 , is proportional to the area of the rupture times the average slip that took place in the earthquake, thus it measures the physical size of the event. M w is derived from it empirically as a quantity without units, just a number designed to conform to the M s scale. [ 37 ] A spectral analysis is required to obtain M 0 .

In contrast, the other magnitudes are derived from a simple measurement of the amplitude of a precisely defined wave. All scales, except M w , saturate for large earthquakes, meaning they are based on the amplitudes of waves that have a wavelength shorter than the rupture length of the earthquakes. These short waves (high-frequency waves) are too short a yardstick to measure the extent of the event. The resulting effective upper limit of measurement for M L is about 7 and about 8.5 [ 38 ] for M s . [ 39 ] New techniques to avoid the saturation problem and to measure magnitudes rapidly for very large earthquakes are being developed. One of these is based on the long-period P-wave; [ 40 ] The other is based on a recently discovered channel wave. [ 41 ] The energy release of an earthquake, [ 42 ] which closely correlates to its destructive power, scales with the 3 ⁄ 2 power of the shaking amplitude (see Moment magnitude scale for an explanation). Thus, a difference in magnitude of 1.0 is equivalent to a factor of 31.6 ( = ( 10 1.0 ) ( 3 / 2 ) {\\displaystyle =({10^{1.0}})^{(3/2)}} ) in the energy released; a difference in magnitude of 2.0 is equivalent to a factor of 1000 ( = ( 10 2.0 ) ( 3 / 2 ) {\\displaystyle =({10^{2.0}})^{(3/2)}} ) in the energy released.

Paleoseismology is a related field that uses geology to infer information regarding past earthquakes. A recording of Earth 's motion as a function of time, created by a seismograph is called a seismogram . A seismologist is a scientist who works in basic or applied seismology. Scholarly interest in earthquakes can be traced back to antiquity. Early speculations on the natural causes of earthquakes were included in the writings of Thales of Miletus ( c. 585 BCE ), Anaximenes of Miletus ( c. 550 BCE ), Aristotle ( c. 340 BCE ), and Zhang Heng (132 CE). In 132 CE, Zhang Heng of China's Han dynasty designed the first known seismoscope .

The earliest responses include work by John Bevis (1757) and John Michell (1761). Michell determined that earthquakes originate within the Earth and were waves of movement caused by \"shifting masses of rock miles below the surface\". [ 5 ] In response to a series of earthquakes near Comrie in Scotland in 1839, a committee was formed in the United Kingdom in order to produce better detection methods for earthquakes. The outcome of this was the production of one of the first modern seismometers by James David Forbes , first presented in a report by David Milne-Home in 1842. [ 6 ] This seismometer was an inverted pendulum, which recorded the measurements of seismic activity through the use of a pencil placed on paper above the pendulum. The designs provided did not prove effective, according to Milne's reports. [ 6 ] From 1857, Robert Mallet laid the foundation of modern instrumental seismology and carried out seismological experiments using explosives. He is also responsible for coining the word \"seismology.\" [ 7 ] He is widely considered to be the \"Father of Seismology\". In 1889 Ernst von Rebeur-Paschwitz recorded the first teleseismic earthquake signal (an earthquake in Japan recorded at Pottsdam Germany).

An 80 kg (180 lb) Wiechert seismograph was brought to the Mexican city of Xalapa by rail after the earthquake. The instrument was deployed to record its aftershocks.

[ 21 ] Seismic waves are elastic waves that propagate in solid or fluid materials. They can be divided into body waves that travel through the interior of the materials; surface waves that travel along surfaces or interfaces between materials; and normal modes , a form of standing wave. There are two types of body waves, pressure waves or primary waves (P waves) and shear or secondary waves ( S waves ). P waves are longitudinal waves associated with compression and expansion , and involve particle motion parallel to the direction of wave propagation. P waves are always the first waves to appear on a seismogram as they are the waves that travel fastest through solids. S waves are transverse waves associated with shear, and involve particle motion perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. S waves travel more slowly than P waves so they appear later than P waves on a seismogram.

[ 22 ] Surface waves are the result of P and S waves interacting with the surface of the Earth. These waves are dispersive , meaning that different frequencies have different velocities. The two main surface wave types are Rayleigh waves , which have both compressional and shear motions, and Love waves , which are purely shear. Rayleigh waves result from the interaction of P waves and vertically polarized S waves with the surface and can exist in any solid medium. Love waves are formed by horizontally polarized S waves interacting with the surface, and can only exist if there is a change in the elastic properties with depth in a solid medium, which is always the case in seismological applications. Surface waves travel more slowly than P waves and S waves because they are the result of these waves traveling along indirect paths to interact with Earth's surface. Because they travel along the surface of the Earth, their energy decays less rapidly than body waves (1/distance 2 vs. 1/distance 3 ), and thus the shaking caused by surface waves is generally stronger than that of body waves, and the primary surface waves are often thus the largest signals on earthquake seismograms . Surface waves are strongly excited when their source is close to the surface, as in a shallow earthquake or a near-surface explosion, and are much weaker for deep earthquake sources. [ 22 ] Both body and surface waves are traveling waves; however, large earthquakes can also make the entire Earth \"ring\" like a resonant bell."

[ 22 ] Both body and surface waves are traveling waves; however, large earthquakes can also make the entire Earth \"ring\" like a resonant bell. This ringing is a mixture of normal modes with discrete frequencies and periods of approximately an hour or shorter. Normal-mode motion caused by a very large earthquake can be observed for up to a month after the event. [ 22 ] The first observations of normal modes were made in the 1960s as the advent of higher-fidelity instruments coincided with two of the largest earthquakes of the 20th century, the 1960 Valdivia earthquake and the 1964 Alaska earthquake . Since then, the normal modes of the Earth have given us some of the strongest constraints on the deep structure of the Earth. One of the first attempts at the scientific study of earthquakes followed the 1755 Lisbon earthquake . Other earthquakes that spurred major advancements in the science of seismology include the 1857 Basilicata earthquake , the 1906 San Francisco earthquake , the 1964 Alaska earthquake , the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake , and the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake . Seismic waves produced by explosions or vibrating controlled sources are one of the primary methods of underground exploration in geophysics (in addition to many different electromagnetic methods such as induced polarization and magnetotellurics ). Controlled-source seismology has been used to map salt domes , anticlines and other geologic traps in petroleum -bearing rocks , faults , rock types, and long-buried giant meteor craters .

For example, the Chicxulub Crater , which was caused by an impact that has been implicated in the extinction of the dinosaurs , was localized to Central America by analyzing ejecta in the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary , and then physically proven to exist using seismic maps from oil exploration . [ 23 ] Seismometers are sensors that detect and record the motion of the Earth arising from elastic waves. Seismometers may be deployed at the Earth's surface, in shallow vaults, in boreholes, or underwater . A complete instrument package that records seismic signals is called a seismograph . Networks of seismographs continuously record ground motions around the world to facilitate the monitoring and analysis of global earthquakes and other sources of seismic activity. Rapid location of earthquakes makes tsunami warnings possible because seismic waves travel considerably faster than tsunami waves. Seismometers also record signals from non-earthquake sources ranging from explosions (nuclear and chemical), to local noise from wind [ 24 ] or anthropogenic activities, to incessant signals generated at the ocean floor and coasts induced by ocean waves (the global microseism ), to cryospheric events associated with large icebergs and glaciers. Above-ocean meteor strikes with energies as high as 4.2 × 10 13 J (equivalent to that released by an explosion of ten kilotons of TNT) have been recorded by seismographs, as have a number of industrial accidents and terrorist bombs and events (a field of study referred to as forensic seismology ).

A major long-term motivation for the global seismographic monitoring has been for the detection and study of nuclear testing . Because seismic waves commonly propagate efficiently as they interact with the internal structure of the Earth, they provide high-resolution noninvasive methods for studying the planet's interior. One of the earliest important discoveries (suggested by Richard Dixon Oldham in 1906 and definitively shown by Harold Jeffreys in 1926) was that the outer core of the earth is liquid. Since S waves do not pass through liquids, the liquid core causes a \"shadow\" on the side of the planet opposite the earthquake where no direct S waves are observed. In addition, P waves travel much slower through the outer core than the mantle. Processing readings from many seismometers using seismic tomography , seismologists have mapped the mantle of the earth to a resolution of several hundred kilometers. This has enabled scientists to identify convection cells and other large-scale features such as the large low-shear-velocity provinces near the core–mantle boundary . [ 25 ] Public controversy over earthquake prediction erupted after Italian authorities indicted six seismologists and one government official for manslaughter in connection with a magnitude 6.3 earthquake in L'Aquila, Italy on April 5, 2009 .

[ 26 ] The indictment claims that, at a special meeting in L'Aquila the week before the earthquake occurred, scientists and officials were more interested in pacifying the population than providing adequate information about earthquake risk and preparedness. [ 26 ] In locations where a historical record exists it may be used to estimate the timing, location and magnitude of future seismic events. There are several interpretative factors to consider. The epicentres or foci and magnitudes of historical earthquakes are subject to interpretation meaning it is possible that 5–6 Mw earthquakes described in the historical record could be larger events occurring elsewhere that were felt moderately in the populated areas that produced written records. Documentation in the historic period may be sparse or incomplete, and not give a full picture of the geographic scope of an earthquake, or the historical record may only have earthquake records spanning a few centuries, a very short time frame in a seismic cycle .

[ 1 ] While the observation of objects in space, known as astronomy , predates reliable recorded history , it was the development of large and relatively efficient rockets during the mid-twentieth century that allowed physical space exploration to become a reality. Common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific research, national prestige, uniting different nations, ensuring the future survival of humanity, and developing military and strategic advantages against other countries. [ 2 ] The early era of space exploration was driven by a \" Space Race \" in which the Soviet Union and the United States vied to demonstrate their technological superiority. Landmarks of this era include the launch of the first human-made object to orbit Earth , the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1 , on 4 October 1957, and the first Moon landing by the American Apollo 11 mission on 20 July 1969. The Soviet space program achieved many of the first milestones, including the first living being in orbit in 1957, the first human spaceflight ( Yuri Gagarin aboard Vostok 1 ) in 1961, the first spacewalk (by Alexei Leonov ) on 18 March 1965, the first automatic landing on another celestial body in 1966, and the launch of the first space station ( Salyut 1 ) in 1971.

MESSENGER and BepiColombo are intended to gather complementary data to help scientists understand many of the mysteries discovered by Mariner 10's flybys . Flights to other planets within the Solar System are accomplished at a cost in energy, which is described by the net change in velocity of the spacecraft, or delta-v . Due to the relatively high delta-v to reach Mercury and its proximity to the Sun, it is difficult to explore and orbits around it are rather unstable.

Space exploration has been used as a tool to understand Earth as a celestial object. Orbital missions can provide data for Earth that can be difficult or impossible to obtain from a purely ground-based point of reference. For example, the existence of the Van Allen radiation belts was unknown until their discovery by the United States' first artificial satellite, Explorer 1 . These belts contain radiation trapped by Earth's magnetic fields, which currently renders construction of habitable space stations above 1000 km impractical. Following this early unexpected discovery, a large number of Earth observation satellites have been deployed specifically to explore Earth from a space-based perspective. These satellites have significantly contributed to the understanding of a variety of Earth-based phenomena. For instance, the hole in the ozone layer was found by an artificial satellite that was exploring Earth's atmosphere, and satellites have allowed for the discovery of archeological sites or geological formations that were difficult or impossible to otherwise identify.

Starting in 1966, the Soviets successfully deployed a number of landers to the Moon which were able to obtain data directly from the Moon's surface; just four months later, Surveyor 1 marked the debut of a successful series of U.S. landers. The Soviet uncrewed missions culminated in the Lunokhod program in the early 1970s, which included the first uncrewed rovers and also successfully brought lunar soil samples to Earth for study. This marked the first (and to date the only) automated return of extraterrestrial soil samples to Earth.

Robotic missions are still pursued vigorously. The exploration of Mars has been an important part of the space exploration programs of the Soviet Union (later Russia), the United States, Europe, Japan, and India. Dozens of robotic spacecraft , including orbiters , landers , and rovers , have been launched toward Mars since the 1960s. These missions were aimed at gathering data about current conditions and answering questions about the history of Mars. The questions raised by the scientific community are expected to not only give a better appreciation of the Red Planet but also yield further insight into the past, and possible future, of Earth. The exploration of Mars has come at a considerable financial cost with roughly two-thirds of all spacecraft destined for Mars failing before completing their missions, with some failing before they even began. Such a high failure rate can be attributed to the complexity and large number of variables involved in an interplanetary journey, and has led researchers to jokingly speak of The Great Galactic Ghoul [ 31 ] which subsists on a diet of Mars probes. This phenomenon is also informally known as the \" Mars Curse \".

[ 32 ] In contrast to overall high failure rates in the exploration of Mars, India has become the first country to achieve success of its maiden attempt. India's Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] is one of the least expensive interplanetary missions ever undertaken with an approximate total cost of ₹ 450 Crore ( US$73 million ). [ 36 ] [ 37 ] The first mission to Mars by any Arab country has been taken up by the United Arab Emirates. Called the Emirates Mars Mission , it was launched on 19 July 2020 and went into orbit around Mars on 9 February 2021. The uncrewed exploratory probe was named \"Hope Probe\" and was sent to Mars to study its atmosphere in detail. [ 38 ] The Russian space mission Fobos-Grunt , which launched on 9 November 2011, experienced a failure leaving it stranded in low Earth orbit . [ 39 ] It was to begin exploration of the Phobos and Martian circumterrestrial orbit, and study whether the moons of Mars, or at least Phobos, could be a \"trans-shipment point\" for spaceships traveling to Mars. [ 40 ] Until the advent of space travel , objects in the asteroid belt were merely pinpricks of light in even the largest telescopes, their shapes and terrain remaining a mystery. Several asteroids have now been visited by probes, the first of which was Galileo , which flew past two: 951 Gaspra in 1991, followed by 243 Ida in 1993. Both of these lay near enough to Galileo' s planned trajectory to Jupiter that they could be visited at acceptable cost. The first landing on an asteroid was performed by the NEAR Shoemaker probe in 2000,"

The dwarf planet Ceres and the asteroid 4 Vesta , two of the three largest asteroids, were visited by NASA's Dawn spacecraft , launched in 2007. Hayabusa was a robotic spacecraft developed by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency to return a sample of material from the small near-Earth asteroid 25143 Itokawa to Earth for further analysis. Hayabusa was launched on 9 May 2003 and rendezvoused with Itokawa in mid-September 2005. After arriving at Itokawa, Hayabusa studied the asteroid's shape, spin, topography, color, composition, density, and history. In November 2005, it landed on the asteroid twice to collect samples. The spacecraft returned to Earth on 13 June 2010. The exploration of Jupiter has consisted solely of a number of automated NASA spacecraft visiting the planet since 1973. A large majority of the missions have been \"flybys\", in which detailed observations are taken without the probe landing or entering orbit; such as in Pioneer and Voyager programs. The Galileo and Juno spacecraft are the only spacecraft to have entered the planet's orbit. As Jupiter is believed to have only a relatively small rocky core and no real solid surface, a landing mission is precluded. Reaching Jupiter from Earth requires a delta-v of 9.2 km/s, [ 41 ] which is comparable to the 9.7 km/s delta-v needed to reach low Earth orbit.

Some exoplanets are so far away from the star that it is difficult to tell whether they are gravitationally bound to it. The nearest exoplanets are located 4.2 light-years (1.3 parsecs ) from Earth and orbit Proxima Centauri , the closest star to the Sun.

There is special interest in planets that orbit in a star's habitable zone (sometimes called \"goldilocks zone\"), where it is possible for liquid water, a prerequisite for life as we know it, to exist on the surface.

Most directly imaged planets as of April 2014 are massive and have wide orbits so probably represent the low-mass end of a brown dwarf formation. [ 28 ] One study suggests that objects above 10 M Jup formed through gravitational instability and should not be thought of as planets. [ 29 ] Also, the 13-Jupiter-mass cutoff does not have a precise physical significance. Deuterium fusion can occur in some objects with a mass below that cutoff. [ 10 ] The amount of deuterium fused depends to some extent on the composition of the object. [ 30 ] In 2011, the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia included objects up to 25 Jupiter masses, saying, \"The fact that there is no special feature around 13 M Jup in the observed mass spectrum reinforces the choice to forget this mass limit\".

[ 49 ] In the eighteenth century, the same possibility was mentioned by Isaac Newton in the \" General Scholium \" that concludes his Principia . Making a comparison to the Sun's planets, he wrote \"And if the fixed stars are the centres of similar systems, they will all be constructed according to a similar design and subject to the dominion of One .\" [ 50 ] In 1938, D.Belorizky demonstrated that it was realistic to search for exo-Jupiters by using transit photometry . [ 51 ] In 1952, more than 40 years before the first hot Jupiter was discovered, Otto Struve wrote that there is no compelling reason that planets could not be much closer to their parent star than is the case in the Solar System, and proposed that Doppler spectroscopy and the transit method could detect super-Jupiters in short orbits. [ 52 ] Claims of exoplanet detections have been made since the nineteenth century. Some of the earliest involve the binary star 70 Ophiuchi .

Kaj Strand of the Sproul Observatory in 1942 observed tiny but systematic variations in the orbital motions of 61 Cygni A and B, suggesting that a third body of about 16 Jupiter masses must be orbiting 61 Cygni A.

As pulsars are aggressive stars, it was considered unlikely at the time that a planet could form in their orbit.

Technological advances, most notably in high-resolution spectroscopy , led to the rapid detection of many new exoplanets: astronomers could detect exoplanets indirectly by measuring their gravitational influence on the motion of their host stars. More extrasolar planets were later detected by observing the variation in a star's apparent luminosity as an orbiting planet transited in front of it. [ 69 ] Initially, most known exoplanets were massive planets that orbited very close to their parent stars. Astronomers were surprised by these \" hot Jupiters \", because theories of planetary formation had indicated that giant planets should only form at large distances from stars. But eventually more planets of other sorts were found, and it is now clear that hot Jupiters make up a minority of exoplanets.

For example, a Sun-like star is about a billion times brighter than the reflected light from any exoplanet orbiting it. It is difficult to detect such a faint light source, and furthermore, the parent star causes a glare that tends to wash it out. It is necessary to block the light from the parent star to reduce the glare while leaving the light from the planet detectable; doing so is a major technical challenge which requires extreme optothermal stability . [ 89 ] Almost all exoplanets that have been directly imaged are both large (more massive than Jupiter ) and widely separated from their parent stars. Specially designed direct-imaging instruments such as Gemini Planet Imager , VLT-SPHERE , and SCExAO will image dozens of gas giants, but the vast majority of known extrasolar planets have only been detected through indirect methods. Planets may form within a few to tens (or more) of millions of years of their star forming.

[ 2 ] In 1731, German philosopher Christian Wolff used the term cosmology in Latin ( cosmologia ) to denote a branch of metaphysics that deals with the general nature of the physical world. [ 3 ] Cosmology is investigated by scientists, including astronomers and physicists , as well as philosophers , such as metaphysicians , philosophers of physics , and philosophers of space and time . Because of this shared scope with philosophy , theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions and may depend upon assumptions that cannot be tested .

In the science of astronomy , physical cosmology is concerned with the study of the chronology of the universe , the observable universe 's origin, its large-scale structures and dynamics, and the ultimate fate of the universe , including the laws of science that govern these areas.

[ 7 ] Physics and astrophysics have played central roles in shaping our understanding of the universe through scientific observation and experiment. Physical cosmology was shaped through both mathematics and observation in an analysis of the whole universe. The universe is generally understood to have begun with the Big Bang , followed almost instantaneously by cosmic inflation , an expansion of space from which the universe is thought to have emerged 13.799 ± 0.021 billion years ago. [ 8 ] Cosmogony studies the origin of the universe, and cosmography maps the features of the universe. In Diderot 's Encyclopédie , cosmology is broken down into uranology (the science of the heavens), aerology (the science of the air), geology (the science of the continents), and hydrology (the science of waters). [ 9 ] Metaphysical cosmology has also been described as the placing of humans in the universe in relationship to all other entities. This is exemplified by Marcus Aurelius 's observation that a man's place in that relationship: \"He who does not know what the world is does not know where he is, and he who does not know for what purpose the world exists, does not know who he is, nor what the world is.\" [ 10 ] Physical cosmology is the branch of physics and astrophysics that deals with the"

It also includes the study of the nature of the universe on a large scale. In its earliest form, it was what is now known as \" celestial mechanics ,\" the study of the heavens . Greek philosophers Aristarchus of Samos , Aristotle , and Ptolemy proposed different cosmological theories. The geocentric Ptolemaic system was the prevailing theory until the 16th century when Nicolaus Copernicus , and subsequently Johannes Kepler and Galileo Galilei , proposed a heliocentric system. This is one of the most famous examples of epistemological rupture in physical cosmology. Isaac Newton 's Principia Mathematica , published in 1687, was the first description of the law of universal gravitation . It provided a physical mechanism for Kepler's laws and also allowed the anomalies in previous systems, caused by gravitational interaction between the planets, to be resolved. A fundamental difference between Newton's cosmology and those preceding it was the Copernican principle —that the bodies on Earth obey the same physical laws as all celestial bodies. This was a crucial philosophical advance in physical cosmology. Modern scientific cosmology is widely considered to have begun in 1917 with Albert Einstein 's publication of his final modification of general relativity in the paper \"Cosmological Considerations of the General Theory of Relativity\" [ 11 ] (although this paper was not widely available outside of Germany until the end of World War I ).

General relativity prompted cosmogonists such as Willem de Sitter , Karl Schwarzschild , and Arthur Eddington to explore its astronomical ramifications, which enhanced the ability of astronomers to study very distant objects. Physicists began changing the assumption that the universe was static and unchanging. In 1922, Alexander Friedmann introduced the idea of an expanding universe that contained moving matter. In parallel to this dynamic approach to cosmology, one long-standing debate about the structure of the cosmos was coming to a climax – the Great Debate (1917 to 1922) – with early cosmologists such as Heber Curtis and Ernst Öpik determining that some nebulae seen in telescopes were separate galaxies far distant from our own. [ 12 ] While Heber Curtis argued for the idea that spiral nebulae were star systems in their own right as island universes, Mount Wilson astronomer Harlow Shapley championed the model of a cosmos made up of the Milky Way star system only. This difference of ideas came to a climax with the organization of the Great Debate on 26 April 1920 at the meeting of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C. The debate was resolved when Edwin Hubble detected Cepheid Variables in the Andromeda Galaxy in 1923 and 1924.

[ 17 ] These findings were a first step to rule out some of many alternative cosmologies . Since around 1990, several dramatic advances in observational cosmology have transformed cosmology from a largely speculative science into a predictive science with precise agreement between theory and observation. These advances include observations of the microwave background from the COBE , [ 18 ] WMAP [ 19 ] and Planck satellites, [ 20 ] large new galaxy redshift surveys including 2dfGRS [ 21 ] and SDSS , [ 22 ] and observations of distant supernovae and gravitational lensing .

It later developed into superstring theory , which posits a connection called supersymmetry between bosons and the class of particles called fermions . Five consistent versions of superstring theory were developed before it was conjectured in the mid-1990s that they were all different limiting cases of a single theory in eleven dimensions known as M-theory . In late 1997, theorists discovered an important relationship called the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence (AdS/CFT correspondence), which relates string theory to another type of physical theory called a quantum field theory .

By the late 1970s, these two frameworks had proven to be sufficient to explain most of the observed features of the universe , from elementary particles to atoms to the evolution of stars and the universe as a whole. [ 1 ] In spite of these successes, there are still many problems that remain to be solved. One of the deepest problems in modern physics is the problem of quantum gravity . [ 1 ] The general theory of relativity is formulated within the framework of classical physics , whereas the other fundamental forces are described within the framework of quantum mechanics. A quantum theory of gravity is needed in order to reconcile general relativity with the principles of quantum mechanics, but difficulties arise when one attempts to apply the usual prescriptions of quantum theory to the force of gravity.

String theory's application as a form of quantum gravity proposes a vibrational state responsible for the graviton , a yet unproven quantum particle that is theorized to carry gravitational force. [ 3 ] One of the main developments of the past several decades in string theory was the discovery of certain 'dualities'—mathematical transformations that identify one physical theory with another. Physicists studying string theory have discovered a number of these dualities between different versions of string theory, and this has led to the conjecture that all consistent versions of string theory are subsumed in a single framework known as M-theory . [ 4 ] Studies of string theory have also yielded a number of results on the nature of black holes and the gravitational interaction. There are certain paradoxes that arise when one attempts to understand the quantum aspects of black holes, and work on string theory has attempted to clarify these issues. In late 1997 this line of work culminated in the discovery of the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence (AdS/CFT for short).

One of the goals of current research in string theory is to find a solution of the theory that reproduces the observed spectrum of elementary particles, with a small cosmological constant , containing dark matter and a plausible mechanism for cosmic inflation .

In particle physics, quantum field theories form the basis for our understanding of elementary particles, which are modeled as excitations in the fundamental fields. [ 13 ] In quantum field theory, one typically computes the probabilities of various physical events using the techniques of perturbation theory . Developed by Richard Feynman and others in the first half of the twentieth century, perturbative quantum field theory uses special diagrams called Feynman diagrams to organize computations. One imagines that these diagrams depict the paths of point-like particles and their interactions. [ 13 ] The starting point for string theory is the idea that the point-like particles of quantum field theory can also be modeled as one-dimensional objects called strings. [ 14 ] The interaction of strings is most straightforwardly defined by generalizing the perturbation theory used in ordinary quantum field theory. At the level of Feynman diagrams, this means replacing the one-dimensional diagram representing the path of a point particle by a two-dimensional (2D) surface representing the motion of a string.

[ 15 ] On much larger length scales, such as the scales visible in physics laboratories, such objects would be indistinguishable from zero-dimensional point particles, and the vibrational state of the string would determine the type of particle. One of the vibrational states of a string corresponds to the graviton, a quantum mechanical particle that carries the gravitational force. [ 3 ] The original version of string theory was bosonic string theory , but this version described only bosons , a class of particles that transmit forces between the matter particles, or fermions . Bosonic string theory was eventually superseded by theories called superstring theories . These theories describe both bosons and fermions, and they incorporate a theoretical idea called supersymmetry . In theories with supersymmetry, each boson has a counterpart which is a fermion, and vice versa. [ 17 ] There are several versions of superstring theory: type I , type IIA , type IIB , and two flavors of heterotic string theory ( SO (32) and E 8 × E 8 ). The different theories allow different types of strings, and the particles that arise at low energies exhibit different symmetries .

Einstein's general theory of relativity treats time as a dimension on par with the three spatial dimensions; in general relativity, space and time are not modeled as separate entities but are instead unified to a four-dimensional (4D) spacetime . In this framework, the phenomenon of gravity is viewed as a consequence of the geometry of spacetime. [ 19 ] In spite of the fact that the Universe is well described by 4D spacetime, there are several reasons why physicists consider theories in other dimensions. In some cases, by modeling spacetime in a different number of dimensions, a theory becomes more mathematically tractable, and one can perform calculations and gain general insights more easily. [ a ] There are also situations where theories in two or three spacetime dimensions are useful for describing phenomena in condensed matter physics. [ 13 ] Finally, there exist scenarios in which there could actually be more than 4D of spacetime which have nonetheless managed to escape detection. [ 20 ] String theories require extra dimensions of spacetime for their mathematical consistency. In bosonic string theory, spacetime is 26-dimensional, while in superstring theory it is 10-dimensional, and in M-theory it is 11-dimensional.

In compactification, some of the extra dimensions are assumed to \"close up\" on themselves to form circles. [ 22 ] In the limit where these curled up dimensions become very small, one obtains a theory in which spacetime has effectively a lower number of dimensions. A standard analogy for this is to consider a multidimensional object such as a garden hose. If the hose is viewed from a sufficient distance, it appears to have only one dimension, its length. However, as one approaches the hose, one discovers that it contains a second dimension, its circumference. Thus, an ant crawling on the surface of the hose would move in two dimensions. Compactification can be used to construct models in which spacetime is effectively four-dimensional. However, not every way of compactifying the extra dimensions produces a model with the right properties to describe nature. In a viable model of particle physics, the compact extra dimensions must be shaped like a Calabi–Yau manifold . [ 22 ] A Calabi–Yau manifold is a special space which is typically taken to be six-dimensional in applications to string theory. It is named after mathematicians Eugenio Calabi and Shing-Tung Yau . [ 23 ] Another approach to reducing the number of dimensions is the so-called brane-world scenario.

[ 24 ] A notable fact about string theory is that the different versions of the theory all turn out to be related in highly nontrivial ways. One of the relationships that can exist between different string theories is called S-duality . This is a relationship that says that a collection of strongly interacting particles in one theory can, in some cases, be viewed as a collection of weakly interacting particles in a completely different theory. Roughly speaking, a collection of particles is said to be strongly interacting if they combine and decay often and weakly interacting if they do so infrequently. Type I string theory turns out to be equivalent by S-duality to the SO (32) heterotic string theory. Similarly, type IIB string theory is related to itself in a nontrivial way by S-duality. [ 25 ] Another relationship between different string theories is T-duality . Here one considers strings propagating around a circular extra dimension. T-duality states that a string propagating around a circle of radius R is equivalent to a string propagating around a circle of radius 1/ R in the sense that all observable quantities in one description are identified with quantities in the dual description. For example, a string has momentum as it propagates"

For example, a string has momentum as it propagates around a circle, and it can also wind around the circle one or more times. The number of times the string winds around a circle is called the winding number . If a string has momentum p and winding number n in one description, it will have momentum n and winding number p in the dual description. For example, type IIA string theory is equivalent to type IIB string theory via T-duality, and the two versions of heterotic string theory are also related by T-duality. [ 25 ] In general, the term duality refers to a situation where two seemingly different physical systems turn out to be equivalent in a nontrivial way. Two theories related by a duality need not be string theories. For example, Montonen–Olive duality is an example of an S-duality relationship between quantum field theories. The AdS/CFT correspondence is an example of a duality that relates string theory to a quantum field theory. If two theories are related by a duality, it means that one theory can be transformed in some way so that it ends up looking just like the other theory. The two theories are then said to be dual to one another under the transformation. Put differently, the two theories are mathematically different descriptions of the same phenomena.

For instance, a point particle can be viewed as a brane of dimension zero, while a string can be viewed as a brane of dimension one. It is also possible to consider higher-dimensional branes. In dimension p , these are called p -branes. The word brane comes from the word \"membrane\" which refers to a two-dimensional brane. [ 27 ] Branes are dynamical objects which can propagate through spacetime according to the rules of quantum mechanics. They have mass and can have other attributes such as charge. A p -brane sweeps out a ( p +1)-dimensional volume in spacetime called its worldvolume . Physicists often study fields analogous to the electromagnetic field which live on the worldvolume of a brane. [ 27 ] In string theory, D-branes are an important class of branes that arise when one considers open strings. As an open string propagates through spacetime, its endpoints are required to lie on a D-brane. The letter \"D\" in D-brane refers to a certain mathematical condition on the system known as the Dirichlet boundary condition . The study of D-branes in string theory has led to important results such as the AdS/CFT correspondence, which has shed light on many problems in quantum field theory.

[ 30 ] Prior to 1995, theorists believed that there were five consistent versions of superstring theory (type I, type IIA, type IIB, and two versions of heterotic string theory). This understanding changed in 1995 when Edward Witten suggested that the five theories were just special limiting cases of an eleven-dimensional theory called M-theory. Witten's conjecture was based on the work of a number of other physicists, including Ashoke Sen , Chris Hull , Paul Townsend , and Michael Duff . His announcement led to a flurry of research activity now known as the second superstring revolution . [ 31 ] In the 1970s, many physicists became interested in supergravity theories, which combine general relativity with supersymmetry. Whereas general relativity makes sense in any number of dimensions, supergravity places an upper limit on the number of dimensions. [ 32 ] In 1978, work by Werner Nahm showed that the maximum spacetime dimension in which one can formulate a consistent supersymmetric theory is eleven.

There are three generations of fermions, although ordinary matter is made only from the first fermion generation. The first generation consists of up and down quarks which form protons and neutrons , and electrons and electron neutrinos . The three fundamental interactions known to be mediated by bosons are electromagnetism , the weak interaction , and the strong interaction . Quarks form hadrons , but cannot exist on their own. Hadrons that contain an odd number of quarks are called baryons and those that contain an even number are called mesons .

The reconciliation of gravity to the current particle physics theory is not solved; many theories have addressed this problem, such as loop quantum gravity , string theory and supersymmetry theory . Experimental particle physics is the study of these particles in radioactive processes and in particle accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider . Theoretical particle physics is the study of these particles in the context of cosmology and quantum theory . The two are closely interrelated: the Higgs boson was postulated theoretically before being confirmed by experiments. The idea that all matter is fundamentally composed of elementary particles dates from at least the 6th century BC. [ 1 ] In the 19th century, John Dalton , through his work on stoichiometry , concluded that each element of nature was composed of a single, unique type of particle. [ 2 ] The word atom , after the Greek word atomos meaning \"indivisible\", has since then denoted the smallest particle of a chemical element , but physicists later discovered that atoms are not, in fact, the fundamental particles of nature, but are conglomerates of even smaller particles, such as the electron .

Bethe's 1947 calculation of the Lamb shift is credited with having \"opened the way to the modern era of particle physics\". [ 3 ] Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, a bewildering variety of particles was found in collisions of particles from beams of increasingly high energy. It was referred to informally as the \" particle zoo \". Important discoveries such as the CP violation by James Cronin and Val Fitch brought new questions to matter-antimatter imbalance . [ 4 ] After the formulation of the Standard Model during the 1970s, physicists clarified the origin of the particle zoo. The large number of particles was explained as combinations of a (relatively) small number of more fundamental particles and framed in the context of quantum field theories . This reclassification marked the beginning of modern particle physics. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] The current state of the classification of all elementary particles is explained by the Standard Model , which gained widespread acceptance in the mid-1970s after experimental confirmation of the existence of quarks . It describes the strong , weak , and electromagnetic fundamental interactions , using mediating gauge bosons . The species of gauge bosons are eight gluons , W − , W + and Z bosons , and the photon .

On 4 July 2012, physicists with the Large Hadron Collider at CERN announced they had found a new particle that behaves similarly to what is expected from the Higgs boson. [ 9 ] The Standard Model, as currently formulated, has 61 elementary particles.

The Standard Model has been found to agree with almost all the experimental tests conducted to date. However, most particle physicists believe that it is an incomplete description of nature and that a more fundamental theory awaits discovery (See Theory of Everything ). In recent years, measurements of neutrino mass have provided the first experimental deviations from the Standard Model, since neutrinos do not have mass in the Standard Model.

In more technical terms, they are described by quantum state vectors in a Hilbert space , which is also treated in quantum field theory . Following the convention of particle physicists, the term elementary particles is applied to those particles that are, according to current understanding, presumed to be indivisible and not composed of other particles.

Some theorists working in this area use the tools of perturbative quantum field theory and effective field theory , referring to themselves as phenomenologists . Others make use of lattice field theory and call themselves lattice theorists .

    "text": "of fractionally charged quarks. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] The term \"Standard Model\" was introduced by Abraham Pais and Sam Treiman in 1975, [ 29 ] with reference to the electroweak theory with four quarks. [ 30 ] Steven Weinberg has since claimed priority, explaining that he chose the term Standard Model out of a sense of modesty [ a ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ better source needed ] and used it in 1973 during a talk in Aix-en-Provence in France. [ 33 ] The Standard Model includes members of several classes of elementary particles, which in turn can be distinguished by other characteristics, such as color charge . All particles can be summarized as follows: Notes : [†] An anti-electron ( e + ) is conventionally called a \" positron \". The Standard Model includes 12 elementary particles of spin ⁠ 1 / 2 ⁠ , known as fermions . [ 34 ] Fermions respect the Pauli exclusion principle , meaning that two identical fermions cannot simultaneously occupy the same quantum state in the same atom. [ 35 ] Each fermion has a corresponding antiparticle , which are particles that have corresponding properties with the exception of opposite charges . [ 36 ] Fermions are classified based on how they interact, which is determined by the charges they carry, into two groups: quarks and leptons . Within each group, pairs of particles that exhibit similar physical behaviors are then grouped into generations (see the table). Each member of a generation has a greater mass than the corresponding particle of generations prior. Thus, there are three generations of quarks and leptons.

[ 37 ] As first-generation particles do not decay, they comprise all of ordinary ( baryonic ) matter. [ 38 ] Specifically, all atoms consist of electrons orbiting around the atomic nucleus , ultimately constituted of up and down quarks. On the other hand, second- and third-generation charged particles decay with very short half-lives and can only be observed in high-energy environments. Neutrinos of all generations also do not decay, and pervade the universe, but rarely interact with baryonic matter. There are six quarks: up , down , charm , strange , top , and bottom . [ 34 ] [ 37 ] Quarks carry color charge , and hence interact via the strong interaction . The color confinement phenomenon results in quarks being strongly bound together such that they form color-neutral composite particles called hadrons ; quarks cannot individually exist and must always bind with other quarks. Hadrons can contain either a quark-antiquark pair ( mesons ) or three quarks ( baryons ). [ 39 ] The lightest baryons are the nucleons : the proton and neutron . Quarks also carry electric charge and weak isospin , and thus interact with other fermions through electromagnetism and weak interaction . The six leptons consist of the electron , electron neutrino , muon , muon neutrino , tau , and tau neutrino . The leptons do not carry color charge, and do not respond to strong interaction. The charged leptons carry an electric charge of −1 e , while the three neutrinos carry zero electric charge.

Thus, the neutrinos' motions are influenced by only the weak interaction and gravity , making them difficult to observe. The Standard Model includes 4 kinds of gauge bosons of spin 1, [ 34 ] with bosons being quantum particles containing an integer spin. The gauge bosons are defined as force carriers , as they are responsible for mediating the fundamental interactions . The Standard Model explains the four fundamental forces as arising from the interactions, with fermions exchanging virtual force carrier particles, thus mediating the forces. At a macroscopic scale, this manifests as a force . [ 41 ] As a result, they do not follow the Pauli exclusion principle that constrains fermions; bosons do not have a theoretical limit on their spatial density . The types of gauge bosons are described below. The Feynman diagram calculations, which are a graphical representation of the perturbation theory approximation, invoke \"force mediating particles\", and when applied to analyze high-energy scattering experiments are in reasonable agreement with the data. However, perturbation theory (and with it the concept of a \"force-mediating particle\") fails in other situations. These include low-energy quantum chromodynamics, bound states , and solitons . The interactions between all the particles described by the Standard Model are summarized by the diagrams on the right of this section.

Hence, Goldstone's original scalar doublet, the massive spin-zero particle, was proposed as the Higgs boson , and is a key building block in the Standard Model. [ 45 ] It has no intrinsic spin , and for that reason is classified as a boson with spin-0. [ 34 ] The Higgs boson plays a unique role in the Standard Model, by explaining why the other elementary particles, except the photon and gluon , are massive. In particular, the Higgs boson explains why the photon has no mass, while the W and Z bosons are very heavy. Elementary-particle masses and the differences between electromagnetism (mediated by the photon) and the weak force (mediated by the W and Z bosons) are critical to many aspects of the structure of microscopic (and hence macroscopic) matter. In electroweak theory , the Higgs boson generates the masses of the leptons (electron, muon, and tau) and quarks. As the Higgs boson is massive, it must interact with itself. Because the Higgs boson is a very massive particle and also decays almost immediately when created, only a very high-energy particle accelerator can observe and record it. Experiments to confirm and determine the nature of the Higgs boson using the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN began in early 2010 and were performed at Fermilab 's Tevatron until its closure in late 2011.

[ 47 ] On 4 July 2012, two of the experiments at the LHC ( ATLAS and CMS ) both reported independently that they had found a new particle with a mass of about 125 GeV/ c 2 (about 133 proton masses, on the order of 10 −25 kg ), which is \"consistent with the Higgs boson\". [ 48 ] [ 49 ] On 13 March 2013, it was confirmed to be the searched-for Higgs boson. [ 50 ] [ 51 ] Technically, quantum field theory provides the mathematical framework for the Standard Model, in which a Lagrangian controls the dynamics and kinematics of the theory. Each kind of particle is described in terms of a dynamical field that pervades space-time . [ 52 ] The construction of the Standard Model proceeds following the modern method of constructing most field theories: by first postulating a set of symmetries of the system, and then by writing down the most general renormalizable Lagrangian from its particle (field) content that observes these symmetries. The global Poincaré symmetry is postulated for all relativistic quantum field theories.

The local SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1) gauge symmetry is an internal symmetry that essentially defines the Standard Model. Roughly, the three factors of the gauge symmetry give rise to the three fundamental interactions. The fields fall into different representations of the various symmetry groups of the Standard Model (see table). Upon writing the most general Lagrangian, one finds that the dynamics depends on 19 parameters, whose numerical values are established by experiment. The parameters are summarized in the table (made visible by clicking \"show\") above.

Thermodynamics applies to various topics in science and engineering , especially physical chemistry , biochemistry , chemical engineering , and mechanical engineering , as well as other complex fields such as meteorology . Historically, thermodynamics developed out of a desire to increase the efficiency of early steam engines , particularly through the work of French physicist Sadi Carnot (1824) who believed that engine efficiency was the key that could help France win the Napoleonic Wars . [ 1 ] Scots-Irish physicist Lord Kelvin was the first to formulate a concise definition of thermodynamics in 1854 [ 2 ] which stated, \"Thermo-dynamics is the subject of the relation of heat to forces acting between contiguous parts of bodies, and the relation of heat to electrical agency.\" German physicist and mathematician Rudolf Clausius restated Carnot's principle known as the Carnot cycle and gave the theory of heat a truer and sounder basis. His most important paper, \"On the Moving Force of Heat\", [ 3 ] published in 1850, first stated the second law of thermodynamics . In 1865 he introduced the concept of entropy.

Chemical thermodynamics studies the nature of the role of entropy in the process of chemical reactions and has provided the bulk of expansion and knowledge of the field. Other formulations of thermodynamics emerged. Statistical thermodynamics , or statistical mechanics, concerns itself with statistical predictions of the collective motion of particles from their microscopic behavior. In 1909, Constantin Carathéodory presented a purely mathematical approach in an axiomatic formulation, a description often referred to as geometrical thermodynamics . A description of any thermodynamic system employs the four laws of thermodynamics that form an axiomatic basis. The first law specifies that energy can be transferred between physical systems as heat , as work , and with the transfer of matter. [ 5 ] The second law defines the existence of a quantity called entropy , which describes the direction, thermodynamically, that a system can evolve and quantifies the state of order of a system and which can be used to quantify the useful work that can be extracted from the system. [ 6 ] In thermodynamics, interactions between large ensembles of objects are studied and categorized. Central to this are the concepts of the thermodynamic system and its surroundings . A system is composed of particles, whose average motions define its properties, and those properties are in turn related to one another through equations of state .

Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is often treated as an extension of the classical treatment, but statistical mechanics has brought many advances to that field. The history of thermodynamics as a scientific discipline generally begins with Otto von Guericke who, in 1650, built and designed the world's first vacuum pump and demonstrated a vacuum using his Magdeburg hemispheres . Guericke was driven to make a vacuum in order to disprove Aristotle 's long-held supposition that 'nature abhors a vacuum'. Shortly after Guericke, the Anglo-Irish physicist and chemist Robert Boyle had learned of Guericke's designs and, in 1656, in coordination with English scientist Robert Hooke , built an air pump .

Later designs implemented a steam release valve that kept the machine from exploding . By watching the valve rhythmically move up and down, Papin conceived of the idea of a piston and a cylinder engine. He did not, however, follow through with his design. Nevertheless, in 1697, based on Papin's designs, engineer Thomas Savery built the first engine, followed by Thomas Newcomen in 1712. Although these early engines were crude and inefficient, they attracted the attention of the leading scientists of the time. The fundamental concepts of heat capacity and latent heat , which were necessary for the development of thermodynamics, were developed by Professor Joseph Black at the University of Glasgow, where James Watt was employed as an instrument maker. Black and Watt performed experiments together, but it was Watt who conceived the idea of the external condenser which resulted in a large increase in steam engine efficiency. [ 11 ] Drawing on all the previous work led Sadi Carnot , the \"father of thermodynamics\", to publish Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire (1824), a discourse on heat, power, energy and engine efficiency. The book outlined the basic energetic relations between the Carnot engine , the Carnot cycle , and motive power. It marked the start of thermodynamics as a modern science. [ 12 ] The"

The book outlined the basic energetic relations between the Carnot engine , the Carnot cycle , and motive power. It marked the start of thermodynamics as a modern science. [ 12 ] The first thermodynamic textbook was written in 1859 by William Rankine , originally trained as a physicist and a civil and mechanical engineering professor at the University of Glasgow . [ 13 ] The first and second laws of thermodynamics emerged simultaneously in the 1850s, primarily out of the works of William Rankine, Rudolf Clausius , and William Thomson (Lord Kelvin). The foundations of statistical thermodynamics were set out by physicists such as James Clerk Maxwell , Ludwig Boltzmann , Max Planck , Rudolf Clausius and J. Willard Gibbs . Clausius, who first stated the basic ideas of the second law in his paper \"On the Moving Force of Heat\", [ 3 ] published in 1850, and is called \"one of the founding fathers of thermodynamics\", [ 14 ] introduced the concept of entropy in 1865. During the years 1873–76 the American mathematical physicist Josiah Willard Gibbs published a series of three papers, the most famous being On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances , [ 15 ] in which he showed how thermodynamic processes , including chemical reactions , could be graphically analyzed, by studying the energy , entropy , volume , temperature and pressure of the thermodynamic system in such a manner, one can determine if a process would occur spontaneously.

[ 17 ] During the early 20th century, chemists such as Gilbert N. Lewis , Merle Randall , [ 18 ] and E. A. Guggenheim [ 19 ] [ 20 ] applied the mathematical methods of Gibbs to the analysis of chemical processes. Thermodynamics has an intricate etymology. [ 21 ] By a surface-level analysis, the word consists of two parts that can be traced back to Ancient Greek. Firstly, thermo- (\"of heat\"; used in words such as thermometer ) can be traced back to the root θέρμη therme , meaning \"heat\". Secondly, the word dynamics (\"science of force [or power]\") [ 22 ] can be traced back to the root δύναμις dynamis , meaning \"power\". [ 23 ] [ 24 ] In 1849, the adjective thermo-dynamic is used by William Thomson. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] In 1854, the noun thermo-dynamics is used by Thomson and William Rankine to represent the science of generalized heat engines. [ 26 ] [ 21 ] Pierre Perrot claims that the term thermodynamics was coined by James Joule in 1858 to designate the science of relations between heat and power, [ 12 ] however, Joule never used that term, but used instead the term perfect thermo-dynamic engine in reference to Thomson's 1849 [ 25 ] phraseology. [ 21 ] The study of thermodynamic systems has developed into several related branches, each using a different fundamental model as a theoretical or experimental basis, or applying the principles to varying types of systems.

Classical thermodynamics is the description of the states of thermodynamic systems at near-equilibrium, that uses macroscopic, measurable properties. It is used to model exchanges of energy, work and heat based on the laws of thermodynamics . The qualifier classical reflects the fact that it represents the first level of understanding of the subject as it developed in the 19th century and describes the changes of a system in terms of macroscopic empirical (large scale, and measurable) parameters. A microscopic interpretation of these concepts was later provided by the development of statistical mechanics . Statistical mechanics , also known as statistical thermodynamics, emerged with the development of atomic and molecular theories in the late 19th century and early 20th century, and supplemented classical thermodynamics with an interpretation of the microscopic interactions between individual particles or quantum-mechanical states. This field relates the microscopic properties of individual atoms and molecules to the macroscopic, bulk properties of materials that can be observed on the human scale, thereby explaining classical thermodynamics as a natural result of statistics, classical mechanics, and quantum theory at the microscopic level. Chemical thermodynamics is the study of the interrelation of energy with chemical reactions or with a physical change of state within the confines of the laws of thermodynamics . The primary objective of chemical thermodynamics is to determine the spontaneity of a given transformation.

The term 'thermodynamic equilibrium' indicates a state of balance, in which all macroscopic flows are zero; in the case of the simplest systems or bodies, their intensive properties are homogeneous, and their pressures are perpendicular to their boundaries. In an equilibrium state there are no unbalanced potentials, or driving forces, between macroscopically distinct parts of the system. A central aim in equilibrium thermodynamics is: given a system in a well-defined initial equilibrium state, and given its surroundings, and given its constitutive walls, to calculate what will be the final equilibrium state of the system after a specified thermodynamic operation has changed its walls or surroundings. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a branch of thermodynamics that deals with systems that are not in thermodynamic equilibrium . Most systems found in nature are not in thermodynamic equilibrium because they are not in stationary states, and are continuously and discontinuously subject to flux of matter and energy to and from other systems. The thermodynamic study of non-equilibrium systems requires more general concepts than are dealt with by equilibrium thermodynamics. [ 28 ] Many natural systems still today remain beyond the scope of currently known macroscopic thermodynamic methods. Thermodynamics is principally based on a set of four laws which are universally valid when applied to systems that fall within the constraints implied by each. In the various theoretical descriptions of thermodynamics these laws may be expressed in seemingly differing forms, but the most prominent formulations are the following.

The zeroth law of thermodynamics states: If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third, they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other. This statement implies that thermal equilibrium is an equivalence relation on the set of thermodynamic systems under consideration. Systems are said to be in equilibrium if the small, random exchanges between them (e.g. Brownian motion ) do not lead to a net change in energy. This law is tacitly assumed in every measurement of temperature. Thus, if one seeks to decide whether two bodies are at the same temperature , it is not necessary to bring them into contact and measure any changes of their observable properties in time. [ 29 ] The law provides an empirical definition of temperature, and justification for the construction of practical thermometers. The zeroth law was not initially recognized as a separate law of thermodynamics, as its basis in thermodynamical equilibrium was implied in the other laws. The first, second, and third laws had been explicitly stated already, and found common acceptance in the physics community before the importance of the zeroth law for the definition of temperature was realized. As it was impractical to renumber the other laws, it was named the zeroth law . The first law of thermodynamics states: In a process without transfer of matter, the change in internal energy , Δ U {\\displaystyle \\Delta U} , of a thermodynamic system is equal to the energy gained as heat, Q {\\displaystyle Q} , less the thermodynamic work, W {\\displaystyle W} , done by the system on its surroundings.

For processes that include transfer of matter, a further statement is needed: With due account of the respective fiducial reference states of the systems, when two systems, which may be of different chemical compositions, initially separated only by an impermeable wall, and otherwise isolated, are combined into a new system by the thermodynamic operation of removal of the wall, then where U 0 denotes the internal energy of the combined system, and U 1 and U 2 denote the internal energies of the respective separated systems.

Adapted for thermodynamics, this law is an expression of the principle of conservation of energy , which states that energy can be transformed (changed from one form to another), but cannot be created or destroyed. [ 34 ] Internal energy is a principal property of the thermodynamic state , while heat and work are modes of energy transfer by which a process may change this state. A change of internal energy of a system may be achieved by any combination of heat added or removed and work performed on or by the system. As a function of state , the internal energy does not depend on the manner, or on the path through intermediate steps, by which the system arrived at its state. A traditional version of the second law of thermodynamics states: Heat does not spontaneously flow from a colder body to a hotter body. The second law refers to a system of matter and radiation, initially with inhomogeneities in temperature, pressure, chemical potential, and other intensive properties , that are due to internal 'constraints', or impermeable rigid walls, within it, or to externally imposed forces. The law observes that, when the system is isolated from the outside world and from those forces, there is a definite thermodynamic quantity, its entropy , that increases as the constraints are removed, eventually reaching a maximum value at thermodynamic equilibrium, when the inhomogeneities practically vanish.

For systems that are initially far from thermodynamic equilibrium, though several have been proposed, there is known no general physical principle that determines the rates of approach to thermodynamic equilibrium, and thermodynamics does not deal with such rates. The many versions of the second law all express the general irreversibility of the transitions involved in systems approaching thermodynamic equilibrium. In macroscopic thermodynamics, the second law is a basic observation applicable to any actual thermodynamic process; in statistical thermodynamics, the second law is postulated to be a consequence of molecular chaos. The third law of thermodynamics states: As the temperature of a system approaches absolute zero, all processes cease and the entropy of the system approaches a minimum value. This law of thermodynamics is a statistical law of nature regarding entropy and the impossibility of reaching absolute zero of temperature. This law provides an absolute reference point for the determination of entropy. The entropy determined relative to this point is the absolute entropy. Alternative definitions include \"the entropy of all systems and of all states of a system is smallest at absolute zero,\" or equivalently \"it is impossible to reach the absolute zero of temperature by any finite number of processes\". Absolute zero, at which all activity would stop if it were possible to achieve, is −273.15 °C (degrees Celsius), or −459.67 °F (degrees Fahrenheit), or 0 K (kelvin), or 0° R (degrees Rankine ).

Everything in the universe except the system is called the surroundings . A system is separated from the remainder of the universe by a boundary which may be a physical or notional, but serve to confine the system to a finite volume. Segments of the boundary are often described as walls ; they have respective defined 'permeabilities'. Transfers of energy as work , or as heat , or of matter , between the system and the surroundings, take place through the walls, according to their respective permeabilities. Matter or energy that pass across the boundary so as to effect a change in the internal energy of the system need to be accounted for in the energy balance equation. The volume contained by the walls can be the region surrounding a single atom resonating energy, such as Max Planck defined in 1900; it can be a body of steam or air in a steam engine , such as Sadi Carnot defined in 1824. The system could also be just one nuclide (i.e. a system of quarks ) as hypothesized in quantum thermodynamics . When a looser viewpoint is adopted, and the requirement of thermodynamic equilibrium is dropped, the system can be the body of a tropical cyclone , such as Kerry Emanuel theorized in 1986 in the field of atm"

It has several subdisciplines, including aerodynamics (the study of air and other gases in motion) and hydrodynamics (the study of water and other liquids in motion). Fluid dynamics has a wide range of applications, including calculating forces and moments on aircraft , determining the mass flow rate of petroleum through pipelines , predicting weather patterns , understanding nebulae in interstellar space , understanding large scale geophysical flows involving oceans/atmosphere and modelling fission weapon detonation . Fluid dynamics offers a systematic structure—which underlies these practical disciplines —that embraces empirical and semi-empirical laws derived from flow measurement and used to solve practical problems. The solution to a fluid dynamics problem typically involves the calculation of various properties of the fluid, such as flow velocity , pressure , density , and temperature , as functions of space and time. Before the twentieth century, \" hydrodynamics \" was synonymous with fluid dynamics. This is still reflected in names of some fluid dynamics topics, like magnetohydrodynamics and hydrodynamic stability , both of which can also be applied to gases. [ 1 ] The foundational axioms of fluid dynamics are the conservation laws , specifically, conservation of mass , conservation of linear momentum , and conservation of energy (also known as the first law of thermodynamics ). These are based on classical mechanics and are modified in quantum mechanics and general relativity . They are expressed using the Reynolds transport theorem .

At small scale, all fluids are composed of molecules that collide with one another and solid objects. However, the continuum assumption assumes that fluids are continuous, rather than discrete. Consequently, it is assumed that properties such as density, pressure, temperature, and flow velocity are well-defined at infinitesimally small points in space and vary continuously from one point to another. The fact that the fluid is made up of discrete molecules is ignored. For fluids that are sufficiently dense to be a continuum, do not contain ionized species, and have flow velocities that are small in relation to the speed of light, the momentum equations for Newtonian fluids are the Navier–Stokes equations —which is a non-linear set of differential equations that describes the flow of a fluid whose stress depends linearly on flow velocity gradients and pressure. The unsimplified equations do not have a general closed-form solution , so they are primarily of use in computational fluid dynamics . The equations can be simplified in several ways, all of which make them easier to solve. Some of the simplifications allow some simple fluid dynamics problems to be solved in closed form. [ citation needed ] In addition to the mass, momentum, and energy conservation equations, a thermodynamic equation of state that gives the pressure as a function of other thermodynamic variables is required to completely describe the problem.

A constitutive relation may also be useful. Three conservation laws are used to solve fluid dynamics problems, and may be written in integral or differential form. The conservation laws may be applied to a region of the flow called a control volume . A control volume is a discrete volume in space through which fluid is assumed to flow. The integral formulations of the conservation laws are used to describe the change of mass, momentum, or energy within the control volume. Differential formulations of the conservation laws apply Stokes' theorem to yield an expression that may be interpreted as the integral form of the law applied to an infinitesimally small volume (at a point) within the flow. In the above integral formulation of this equation, the term on the left is the net change of momentum within the volume. The first term on the right is the net rate at which momentum is convected into the volume. The second term on the right is the force due to pressure on the volume's surfaces. The first two terms on the right are negated since momentum entering the system is accounted as positive, and the normal is opposite the direction of the velocity u and pressure forces.

Surface forces , such as viscous forces, are represented by F surf , the net force due to shear forces acting on the volume surface. The momentum balance can also be written for a moving control volume. [ 3 ] The following is the differential form of the momentum conservation equation. Here, the volume is reduced to an infinitesimally small point, and both surface and body forces are accounted for in one total force, F . For example, F may be expanded into an expression for the frictional and gravitational forces acting at a point in a flow.

However, in many situations the changes in pressure and temperature are sufficiently small that the changes in density are negligible. In this case the flow can be modelled as an incompressible flow . Otherwise the more general compressible flow equations must be used. Mathematically, incompressibility is expressed by saying that the density ρ of a fluid parcel does not change as it moves in the flow field, that is, D ρ D t = 0 , {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\mathrm {D} \\rho }{\\mathrm {D} t}}=0\\,,} where ⁠ D / D t ⁠ is the material derivative , which is the sum of local and"

This additional constraint simplifies the governing equations, especially in the case when the fluid has a uniform density. For flow of gases, to determine whether to use compressible or incompressible fluid dynamics, the Mach number of the flow is evaluated. As a rough guide, compressible effects can be ignored at Mach numbers below approximately 0.3. For liquids, whether the incompressible assumption is valid depends on the fluid properties (specifically the critical pressure and temperature of the fluid) and the flow conditions (how close to the critical pressure the actual flow pressure becomes). Acoustic problems always require allowing compressibility, since sound waves are compression waves involving changes in pressure and density of the medium through which they propagate. All fluids, except superfluids , are viscous, meaning that they exert some resistance to deformation: neighbouring parcels of fluid moving at different velocities exert viscous forces on each other. The velocity gradient is referred to as a strain rate ; it has dimensions T −1 . Isaac Newton showed that for many familiar fluids such as water and air , the stress due to these viscous forces is linearly related to the strain rate. Such fluids are called Newtonian fluids . The coefficient of proportionality is called the fluid's viscosity; for Newtonian fluids, it is a fluid property that is independent of the strain rate.

The sub-discipline of rheology describes the stress-strain behaviours of such fluids, which include emulsions and slurries , some viscoelastic materials such as blood and some polymers , and sticky liquids such as latex , honey and lubricants . [ 5 ] The dynamic of fluid parcels is described with the help of Newton's second law . An accelerating parcel of fluid is subject to inertial effects. The Reynolds number is a dimensionless quantity which characterises the magnitude of inertial effects compared to the magnitude of viscous effects. A low Reynolds number ( Re ≪ 1 ) indicates that viscous forces are very strong compared to inertial forces. In such cases, inertial forces are sometimes neglected; this flow regime is called Stokes or creeping flow . In contrast, high Reynolds numbers ( Re ≫ 1 ) indicate that the inertial effects have more effect on the velocity field than the viscous (friction) effects. In high Reynolds number flows, the flow is often modeled as an inviscid flow , an approximation in which viscosity is completely neglected. Eliminating viscosity allows the Navier–Stokes equations to be simplified into the Euler equations . The integration of the Euler equations along a streamline in an inviscid flow yields Bernoulli's equation . When, in addition to being inviscid, the flow is irrotational everywhere, Bernoulli's equation can completely describe the flow everywhere.

However, problems such as those involving solid boundaries may require that the viscosity be included. Viscosity cannot be neglected near solid boundaries because the no-slip condition generates a thin region of large strain rate, the boundary layer , in which viscosity effects dominate and which thus generates vorticity . Therefore, to calculate net forces on bodies (such as wings), viscous flow equations must be used: inviscid flow theory fails to predict drag forces , a limitation known as the d'Alembert's paradox . A commonly used [ 6 ] model, especially in computational fluid dynamics , is to use two flow models: the Euler equations away from the body, and boundary layer equations in a region close to the body. The two solutions can then be matched with each other, using the method of matched asymptotic expansions . A flow that is not a function of time is called steady flow . Steady-state flow refers to the condition where the fluid properties at a point in the system do not change over time. Time dependent flow is known as unsteady (also called transient [ 8 ] ). Whether a particular flow is steady or unsteady, can depend on the chosen frame of reference. For instance, laminar flow over a sphere is steady in the frame of reference that is stationary with respect to the sphere. In a frame of reference that is stationary with respect to a background flow, the flow is unsteady. Turbulent flows are unsteady by definition.

A turbulent flow can, however, be statistically stationary . The random velocity field U ( x , t ) is statistically stationary if all statistics are invariant under a shift in time. [ 9 ] : 75 This roughly means that all statistical properties are constant in time. Often, the mean field is the object of interest, and this is constant too in a statistically stationary flow. Steady flows are often more tractable than otherwise similar unsteady flows. The governing equations of a steady problem have one dimension fewer (time) than the governing equations of the same problem without taking advantage of the steadiness of the flow field. Turbulence is flow characterized by recirculation, eddies , and apparent randomness . Flow in which turbulence is not exhibited is called laminar . The presence of eddies or recirculation alone does not necessarily indicate turbulent flow—these phenomena may be present in laminar flow as well. Mathematically, turbulent flow is often represented via a Reynolds decomposition , in which the flow is broken down into the sum of an average component and a perturbation component. It is believed that turbulent flows can be described well through the use of the Navier–Stokes equations . Direct numerical simulation (DNS), based on the Navier–Stokes equations, makes it possible to simulate turbulent flows at moderate Reynolds numbers.

Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations (RANS) combined with turbulence modelling provides a model of the effects of the turbulent flow. Such a modelling mainly provides the additional momentum transfer by the Reynolds stresses , although the turbulence also enhances the heat and mass transfer . Another promising methodology is large eddy simulation (LES), especially in the form of detached eddy simulation (DES) — a combination of LES and RANS turbulence modelling. There are a large number of other possible approximations to fluid dynamic problems. Some of the more commonly used are listed below. While many flows (such as flow of water through a pipe) occur at low Mach numbers ( subsonic flows), many flows of practical interest in aerodynamics or in turbomachines occur at high fractions of M = 1 ( transonic flows ) or in excess of it ( supersonic or even hypersonic flows ).

New phenomena occur at these regimes such as instabilities in transonic flow, shock waves for supersonic flow, or non-equilibrium chemical behaviour due to ionization in hypersonic flows. In practice, each of those flow regimes is treated separately. Reactive flows are flows that are chemically reactive, which finds its applications in many areas, including combustion ( IC engine ), propulsion devices ( rockets , jet engines , and so on), detonations , fire and safety hazards, and astrophysics. In addition to conservation of mass, momentum and energy, conservation of individual species (for example, mass fraction of methane in methane combustion) need to be derived, where the production/depletion rate of any species are obtained by simultaneously solving the equations of chemical kinetics . Magnetohydrodynamics is the multidisciplinary study of the flow of electrically conducting fluids in electromagnetic fields. Examples of such fluids include plasmas , liquid metals, and salt water . The fluid flow equations are solved simultaneously with Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism. Relativistic fluid dynamics studies the macroscopic and microscopic fluid motion at large velocities comparable to the velocity of light .

The concept of pressure is central to the study of both fluid statics and fluid dynamics. A pressure can be identified for every point in a body of fluid, regardless of whether the fluid is in motion or not. Pressure can be measured using an aneroid, Bourdon tube, mercury column, or various other methods.

To avoid potential ambiguity when referring to pressure in fluid dynamics, many authors use the term static pressure to distinguish it from total pressure and dynamic pressure. Static pressure is identical to pressure and can be identified for every point in a fluid flow field. A point in a fluid flow where the flow has come to rest (that is to say, speed is equal to zero adjacent to some solid body immersed in the fluid flow) is of special significance. It is of such importance that it is given a special name—a stagnation point . The static pressure at the stagnation point is of special significance and is given its own name— stagnation pressure . Bernoulli’s equation is not valid in the boundary layer and the thin film of stationary fluid adjacent to a solid object is not regarded as a stagnation point. Static pressure in the boundary layer is not related to stagnation pressure. In the absence of shocks the stagnation pressure at a stagnation point is equal to the total pressure throughout the flow field. In a compressible fluid, it is convenient to define the total conditions (also called stagnation conditions) for all thermodynamic state properties (such as total temperature, total enthalpy, total speed of sound).

Where there is no prefix, the fluid property is the static condition (so \"density\" and \"static density\" mean the same thing). The static conditions are independent of the frame of reference. Because the total flow conditions are defined by isentropically bringing the fluid to rest, there is no need to distinguish between total entropy and static entropy as they are always equal by definition. As such, entropy is most commonly referred to as simply \"entropy\"."

[ 1 ] It involves topics covered in the field of fluid dynamics and its subfield of gas dynamics , and is an important domain of study in aeronautics . The term aerodynamics is often used synonymously with gas dynamics, the difference being that \"gas dynamics\" applies to the study of the motion of all gases, and is not limited to air. The formal study of aerodynamics began in the modern sense in the eighteenth century, although observations of fundamental concepts such as aerodynamic drag were recorded much earlier. Most of the early efforts in aerodynamics were directed toward achieving heavier-than-air flight , which was first demonstrated by Otto Lilienthal in 1891. [ 2 ] Since then, the use of aerodynamics through mathematical analysis, empirical approximations, wind tunnel experimentation, and computer simulations has formed a rational basis for the development of heavier-than-air flight and a number of other technologies. Recent work in aerodynamics has focused on issues related to compressible flow , turbulence , and boundary layers and has become increasingly computational in nature. Modern aerodynamics only dates back to the seventeenth century, but aerodynamic forces have been harnessed by humans for thousands of years in sailboats and windmills, [ 3 ] and images and stories of flight appear throughout recorded history, [ 4 ] such as the Ancient Greek legend of Icarus and Daedalus .

Dutch - Swiss mathematician Daniel Bernoulli followed in 1738 with Hydrodynamica in which he described a fundamental relationship between pressure, density, and flow velocity for incompressible flow known today as Bernoulli's principle , which provides one method for calculating aerodynamic lift. [ 8 ] In 1757, Leonhard Euler published the more general Euler equations which could be applied to both compressible and incompressible flows. The Euler equations were extended to incorporate the effects of viscosity in the first half of the 1800s, resulting in the Navier–Stokes equations . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] The Navier–Stokes equations are the most general governing equations of fluid flow but are difficult to solve for the flow around all but the simplest of shapes. In 1799, Sir George Cayley became the first person to identify the four aerodynamic forces of flight ( weight , lift , drag , and thrust ), as well as the relationships between them, [ 11 ] [ 12 ] and in doing so outlined the path toward achieving heavier-than-air flight for the next century.

[ 16 ] Otto Lilienthal , the first person to become highly successful with glider flights, was also the first to propose thin, curved airfoils that would produce high lift and low drag. Building on these developments as well as research carried out in their own wind tunnel, the Wright brothers flew the first powered airplane on December 17, 1903. During the time of the first flights, Frederick W. Lanchester , [ 17 ] Martin Kutta , and Nikolai Zhukovsky independently created theories that connected circulation of a fluid flow to lift. Kutta and Zhukovsky went on to develop a two-dimensional wing theory. Expanding upon the work of Lanchester, Ludwig Prandtl is credited with developing the mathematics [ 18 ] behind thin-airfoil and lifting-line theories as well as work with boundary layers . As aircraft speed increased designers began to encounter challenges associated with air compressibility at speeds near the speed of sound. The differences in airflow under such conditions lead to problems in aircraft control, increased drag due to shock waves , and the threat of structural failure due to aeroelastic flutter . The ratio of the flow speed to the speed of sound was named the Mach number after Ernst Mach who was one of the first to investigate the properties of the supersonic flow.

[ 19 ] Theodore von Kármán and Hugh Latimer Dryden introduced the term transonic to describe flow speeds between the critical Mach number and Mach 1 where drag increases rapidly. This rapid increase in drag led aerodynamicists and aviators to disagree on whether supersonic flight was achievable until the sound barrier was broken in 1947 using the Bell X-1 aircraft. By the time the sound barrier was broken, aerodynamicists' understanding of the subsonic and low supersonic flow had matured. The Cold War prompted the design of an ever-evolving line of high-performance aircraft. Computational fluid dynamics began as an effort to solve for flow properties around complex objects and has rapidly grown to the point where entire aircraft can be designed using computer software, with wind-tunnel tests followed by flight tests to confirm the computer predictions. Understanding of supersonic and hypersonic aerodynamics has matured since the 1960s, and the goals of aerodynamicists have shifted from the behaviour of fluid flow to the engineering of a vehicle such that it interacts predictably with the fluid flow. Designing aircraft for supersonic and hypersonic conditions, as well as the desire to improve the aerodynamic efficiency of current aircraft and propulsion systems, continues to motivate new research in aerodynamics, while work continues to be done on important problems in basic aerodynamic theory related to flow turbulence and the existence and uniqueness of analytical solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations.

Understanding the motion of air around an object (often called a flow field) enables the calculation of forces and moments acting on the object. In many aerodynamics problems, the forces of interest are the fundamental forces of flight: lift , drag , thrust , and weight . Of these, lift and drag are aerodynamic forces, i.e. forces due to air flow over a solid body. Calculation of these quantities is often founded upon the assumption that the flow field behaves as a continuum. Continuum flow fields are characterized by properties such as flow velocity , pressure , density , and temperature , which may be functions of position and time. These properties may be directly or indirectly measured in aerodynamics experiments or calculated starting with the equations for conservation of mass, momentum , and energy in air flows. Density, flow velocity, and an additional property, viscosity , are used to classify flow fields. Flow velocity is used to classify flows according to speed regime. Subsonic flows are flow fields in which the air speed field is always below the local speed of sound. Transonic flows include both regions of subsonic flow and regions in which the local flow speed is greater than the local speed of sound.

Compressible flow accounts for varying density within the flow. Subsonic flows are often idealized as incompressible, i.e. the density is assumed to be constant. Transonic and supersonic flows are compressible, and calculations that neglect the changes of density in these flow fields will yield inaccurate results. Viscosity is associated with the frictional forces in a flow. In some flow fields, viscous effects are very small, and approximate solutions may safely neglect viscous effects. These approximations are called inviscid flows. Flows for which viscosity is not neglected are called viscous flows. Finally, aerodynamic problems may also be classified by the flow environment. External aerodynamics is the study of flow around solid objects of various shapes (e.g. around an airplane wing), while internal aerodynamics is the study of flow through passages inside solid objects (e.g. through a jet engine). Unlike liquids and solids, gases are composed of discrete molecules which occupy only a small fraction of the volume filled by the gas. On a molecular level, flow fields are made up of the collisions of many individual gas molecules among themselves, and their collisions with solid surfaces. However, in most aerodynamics applications, the discrete molecular nature of gases is ignored, and the flow field is assumed to behave as a continuum .

The validity of the continuum assumption is dependent on the density of the gas and the application in question. For the continuum assumption to be valid, the mean free path length must be much smaller than the length scale of the application in question. For example, many aerodynamics applications deal with aircraft flying in atmospheric conditions, where the mean free path length is on the order of micrometers and where the body is orders of magnitude larger. In these cases, the length scale of the aircraft ranges from a few meters to a few tens of meters, which is much larger than the mean free path length. For such applications, the continuum assumption is reasonable. The continuum assumption is less valid for extremely low-density flows, such as those encountered by vehicles at very high altitudes (e.g. 300,000 ft/90 km) [ 6 ] or satellites in Low Earth orbit . In those cases, statistical mechanics is a more accurate method of solving the problem than is continuum aerodynamics. The Knudsen number can be used to guide the choice between statistical mechanics and the continuous formulation of aerodynamics. The assumption of a fluid continuum allows problems in aerodynamics to be solved using fluid dynamics conservation laws .

The Euler equations are a set of similar conservation equations which neglect viscosity and may be used in cases where the effect of viscosity is expected to be small. Further simplifications lead to Laplace's equation and potential flow theory. Additionally, Bernoulli's equation is a solution in one dimension to both the momentum and energy conservation equations. The ideal gas law or another such equation of state is often used in conjunction with these equations to form a determined system that allows the solution for the unknown variables.

Aerodynamicists disagree over the precise definition of hypersonic flow; a rough definition considers flows with Mach numbers above 5 to be hypersonic. [ 6 ] The influence of viscosity on the flow dictates a third classification. Some problems may encounter only very small viscous effects, in which case viscosity can be considered to be negligible. The approximations to these problems are called inviscid flows . Flows for which viscosity cannot be neglected are called viscous flows. An incompressible flow is a flow in which density is constant in both time and space. Although all real fluids are compressible, a flow is often approximated as incompressible if the effect of the density changes cause only small changes to the calculated results. This is more likely to be true when the flow speeds are significantly lower than the speed of sound. Effects of compressibility are more significant at speeds close to or above the speed of sound. The Mach number is used to evaluate whether the incompressibility can be assumed, otherwise the effects of compressibility must be included.

Subsonic (or low-speed) aerodynamics describes fluid motion in flows which are much lower than the speed of sound everywhere in the flow. There are several branches of subsonic flow but one special case arises when the flow is inviscid , incompressible and irrotational . This case is called potential flow and allows the differential equations that describe the flow to be a simplified version of the equations of fluid dynamics , thus making available to the aerodynamicist a range of quick and easy solutions. [ 21 ] In solving a subsonic problem, one decision to be made by the aerodynamicist is whether to incorporate the effects of compressibility. Compressibility is a description of the amount of change of density in the flow. When the effects of compressibility on the solution are small, the assumption that density is constant may be made. The problem is then an incompressible low-speed aerodynamics problem. When the density is allowed to vary, the flow is called compressible. In air, compressibility effects are usually ignored when the Mach number in the flow does not exceed 0.3 (about 335 feet (102 m) per second or 228 miles (366 km) per hour at 60 °F (16 °C)). Above Mach 0.3, the problem flow should be described using compressible aerodynamics. According to the theory of aerodynamics, a flow is considered to be compressible if the density changes along a streamline . This means that – unlike incompressible flow – changes in density are considered. In general, this is the case where the Mach number in part or all of the flow exceeds 0.3.

The Mach 0.3 value is rather arbitrary, but it is used because gas flows with a Mach number below that value demonstrate changes in density of less than 5%. Furthermore, that maximum 5% density change occurs at the stagnation point (the point on the object where flow speed is zero), while the density changes around the rest of the object will be significantly lower. Transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic flows are all compressible flows. The term Transonic refers to a range of flow velocities just below and above the local speed of sound (generally taken as Mach 0.8–1.2). It is defined as the range of speeds between the critical Mach number , when some parts of the airflow over an aircraft become supersonic , and a higher speed, typically near Mach 1.2 , when all of the airflow is supersonic. Between these speeds, some of the airflow is supersonic, while some of the airflow is not supersonic. Supersonic aerodynamic problems are those involving flow speeds greater than the speed of sound. Calculating the lift on the Concorde during cruise can be an example of a supersonic aerodynamic problem. Supersonic flow behaves very differently from subsonic flow. Fluids react to differences in pressure; pressure changes are how a fluid is \"told\" to respond to its environment. Therefore, since sound is, in fact, an infinitesimal pressure difference propagating through a fluid, the speed of sound in that fluid can be considered the fastest speed that \"information\" can travel in the flow.

This difference most obviously manifests itself in the case of a fluid striking an object. In front of that object, the fluid builds up a stagnation pressure as impact with the object brings the moving fluid to rest. In fluid traveling at subsonic speed, this pressure disturbance can propagate upstream, changing the flow pattern ahead of the object and giving the impression that the fluid \"knows\" the object is there by seemingly adjusting its movement and is flowing around it. In a supersonic flow, however, the pressure disturbance cannot propagate upstream. Thus, when the fluid finally reaches the object it strikes it and the fluid is forced to change its properties – temperature , density , pressure , and Mach number —in an extremely violent and irreversible fashion called a shock wave . The presence of shock waves, along with the compressibility effects of high-flow velocity (see Reynolds number ) fluids, is the central difference between the supersonic and subsonic aerodynamics regimes. In aerodynamics, hypersonic speeds are speeds that are highly supersonic. In the 1970s, the term generally came to refer to speeds of Mach 5 (5 times the speed of sound) and above. The hypersonic regime is a subset of the supersonic regime. Hypersonic flow is characterized by high temperature flow behind a shock wave, viscous interaction, and chemical dissociation of gas.

[ 1 ] Within mechanical engineering , robotics is the design and construction of the physical structures of robots, while in computer science , robotics focuses on robotic automation algorithms. Other disciplines contributing to robotics include electrical , control , software , information , electronic , telecommunication , computer , mechatronic , and materials engineering. The goal of most robotics is to design machines that can help and assist humans . Many robots are built to do jobs that are hazardous to people, such as finding survivors in unstable ruins, and exploring space, mines and shipwrecks. Others replace people in jobs that are boring, repetitive, or unpleasant, such as cleaning, monitoring, transporting, and assembling. Today, robotics is a rapidly growing field, as technological advances continue; researching, designing, and building new robots serve various practical purposes. A roboticist is someone who specializes in robotics. Robotics usually combines three aspects of design work to create robot systems: As many robots are designed for specific tasks, this method of classification becomes more relevant. For example, many robots are designed for assembly work, which may not be readily adaptable for other applications. They are termed \"assembly robots\". For seam welding, some suppliers provide complete welding systems with the robot i.e. the welding equipment along with other material handling facilities like turntables, etc. as an integrated unit. Such an integrated robotic system is called a \"welding robot\" even though its discrete manipulator unit could be adapted to a variety of tasks. Some robots are specifically designed for heavy load manipulation, and are labeled as \"heavy-duty robots\".

Some robots are specifically designed for heavy load manipulation, and are labeled as \"heavy-duty robots\". [ 4 ] Current and potential applications include: At present, mostly (lead–acid) batteries are used as a power source. Many different types of batteries can be used as a power source for robots. They range from lead–acid batteries, which are safe and have relatively long shelf lives but are rather heavy compared to silver–cadmium batteries which are much smaller in volume and are currently much more expensive. Designing a battery-powered robot needs to take into account factors such as safety, cycle lifetime, and weight . Generators, often some type of internal combustion engine , can also be used. However, such designs are often mechanically complex and need fuel, require heat dissipation, and are relatively heavy. A tether connecting the robot to a power supply would remove the power supply from the robot entirely. This has the advantage of saving weight and space by moving all power generation and storage components elsewhere. However, this design does come with the drawback of constantly having a cable connected to the robot, which can be difficult to manage. [ 16 ] Potential power sources could be: Actuators are the \" muscles \" of a robot, the parts which convert stored energy into movement. [ 17 ] By far the most popular actuators are electric motors that rotate a wheel or gear, and linear actuators that control industrial robots in factories. There are some recent advances in alternative types of actuators, powered by electricity, chemicals, or compressed air.

The vast majority of robots use electric motors , often brushed and brushless DC motors in portable robots or AC motors in industrial robots and CNC machines. These motors are often preferred in systems with lighter loads, and where the predominant form of motion is rotational. Various types of linear actuators move in and out instead of by spinning, and often have quicker direction changes, particularly when very large forces are needed such as with industrial robotics. They are typically powered by compressed air ( pneumatic actuator ) or an oil ( hydraulic actuator ) Linear actuators can also be powered by electricity which usually consists of a motor and a leadscrew. Another common type is a mechanical linear actuator such as a rack and pinion on a car. Series elastic actuation (SEA) relies on the idea of introducing intentional elasticity between the motor actuator and the load for robust force control. Due to the resultant lower reflected inertia, series elastic actuation improves safety when a robot interacts with the environment (e.g., humans or workpieces) or during collisions. [ 18 ] Furthermore, it also provides energy efficiency and shock absorption (mechanical filtering) while reducing excessive wear on the transmission and other mechanical components. This approach has successfully been employed in various robots, particularly advanced manufacturing robots [ 19 ] and walking humanoid robots. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] The controller design of a series elastic actuator is most often performed within the passivity framework as it ensures the safety of interaction with unstructured environments.

[ 22 ] Despite its remarkable stability and robustness, this framework suffers from the stringent limitations imposed on the controller which may trade-off performance. The reader is referred to the following survey which summarizes the common controller architectures for SEA along with the corresponding sufficient passivity conditions. [ 23 ] One recent study has derived the necessary and sufficient passivity conditions for one of the most common impedance control architectures, namely velocity-sourced SEA. [ 24 ] This work is of particular importance as it drives the non-conservative passivity bounds in an SEA scheme for the first time which allows a larger selection of control gains. Pneumatic artificial muscles also known as air muscles, are special tubes that expand (typically up to 42%) when air is forced inside them. They are used in some robot applications. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] Muscle wire, also known as shape memory alloy, is a material that contracts (under 5%) when electricity is applied. They have been used for some small robot applications. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] EAPs or EPAMs are a plastic material that can contract substantially (up to 380% activation strain) from electricity, and have been used in facial muscles and arms of humanoid robots, [ 30 ] and to enable new robots to float, [ 31 ] fly, swim or walk.

These work on a fundamentally different principle, whereby tiny piezoceramic elements, vibrating many thousands of times per second, cause linear or rotary motion. There are different mechanisms of operation; one type uses the vibration of the piezo elements to step the motor in a circle or a straight line. [ 33 ] Another type uses the piezo elements to cause a nut to vibrate or to drive a screw. The advantages of these motors are nanometer resolution, speed, and available force for their size. [ 34 ] These motors are already available commercially and being used on some robots. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] Elastic nanotubes are a promising artificial muscle technology in early-stage experimental development. The absence of defects in carbon nanotubes enables these filaments to deform elastically by several percent, with energy storage levels of perhaps 10 J /cm 3 for metal nanotubes. Human biceps could be replaced with an 8 mm diameter wire of this material. Such compact \"muscle\" might allow future robots to outrun and outjump humans. [ 37 ] Sensors allow robots to receive information about a certain measurement of the environment, or internal components. This is essential for robots to perform their tasks, and act upon any changes in the environment to calculate the appropriate response. They are used for various forms of measurements, to give the robots warnings about safety or malfunctions, and to provide real-time information about the task it is performing.

Recent research has developed a tactile sensor array that mimics the mechanical properties and touch receptors of human fingertips. [ 38 ] [ 39 ] The sensor array is constructed as a rigid core surrounded by conductive fluid contained by an elastomeric skin. Electrodes are mounted on the surface of the rigid core and are connected to an impedance-measuring device within the core. When the artificial skin touches an object the fluid path around the electrodes is deformed, producing impedance changes that map the forces received from the object. The researchers expect that an important function of such artificial fingertips will be adjusting the robotic grip on held objects. Scientists from several European countries and Israel developed a prosthetic hand in 2009, called SmartHand, which functions like a real one —allowing patients to write with it, type on a keyboard , play piano, and perform other fine movements. The prosthesis has sensors which enable the patient to sense real feelings in its fingertips. [ 40 ] Other common forms of sensing in robotics use lidar, radar, and sonar. [ 41 ] Lidar measures the distance to a target by illuminating the target with laser light and measuring the reflected light with a sensor. Radar uses radio waves to determine the range, angle, or velocity of objects. Sonar uses sound propagation to navigate, communicate with or detect objects on or under the surface of the water.

Fingers can, for example, be made of a chain with a metal wire running through it. [ 42 ] Hands that resemble and work more like a human hand include the Shadow Hand and the Robonaut hand. [ 43 ] Hands that are of a mid-level complexity include the Delft hand. [ 44 ] [ 45 ] Mechanical grippers can come in various types, including friction and encompassing jaws. Friction jaws use all the force of the gripper to hold the object in place using friction. Encompassing jaws cradle the object in place, using less friction. Suction end-effectors, powered by vacuum generators, are very simple astrictive [ 46 ] devices that can hold very large loads provided the prehension surface is smooth enough to ensure suction. Pick and place robots for electronic components and for large objects like car windscreens, often use very simple vacuum end-effectors. Suction is a highly used type of end-effector in industry, in part because the natural compliance of soft suction end-effectors can enable a robot to be more robust in the presence of imperfect robotic perception. As an example: consider the case of a robot vision system that estimates the position of a water bottle but has 1 centimeter of error. While this may cause a rigid mechanical gripper to puncture the water bottle, the soft suction end-effector may just bend slightly and conform to the shape of the water bottle surface.

[ 48 ] They have powerful Robot Dexterity Intelligence (RDI), with as many as 20 degrees of freedom and hundreds of tactile sensors. [ 49 ] The mechanical structure of a robot must be controlled to perform tasks. [ 50 ] The control of a robot involves three distinct phases – perception , processing, and action ( robotic paradigms ). [ 51 ] Sensors give information about the environment or the robot itself (e.g. the position of its joints or its end effector). This information is then processed to be stored or transmitted and to calculate the appropriate signals to the actuators ( motors ), which move the mechanical structure to achieve the required co-ordinated motion or force actions. The processing phase can range in complexity. At a reactive level, it may translate raw sensor information directly into actuator commands (e.g. firing motor power electronic gates based directly upon encoder feedback signals to achieve the required torque/velocity of the shaft). Sensor fusion and internal models may first be used to estimate parameters of interest (e.g. the position of the robot's gripper) from noisy sensor data. An immediate task (such as moving the gripper in a certain direction until an object is detected with a proximity sensor) is sometimes inferred from these estimates. Techniques from control theory are generally used to convert the higher-level tasks into individual commands that drive the actuators, most often using kinematic and dynamic models of the mechanical structure.

[ 50 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ] At longer time scales or with more sophisticated tasks, the robot may need to build and reason with a \"cognitive\" model. Cognitive models try to represent the robot, the world, and how the two interact. Pattern recognition and computer vision can be used to track objects. [ 50 ] Mapping techniques can be used to build maps of the world. Finally, motion planning and other artificial intelligence techniques may be used to figure out how to act. For example, a planner may figure out how to achieve a task without hitting obstacles, falling over, etc. Modern commercial robotic control systems are highly complex, integrate multiple sensors and effectors, have many interacting degrees-of-freedom (DOF) and require operator interfaces, programming tools and real-time capabilities. [ 51 ] They are oftentimes interconnected to wider communication networks and in many cases are now both IoT -enabled and mobile. [ 53 ] Progress towards open architecture, layered, user-friendly and 'intelligent' sensor-based interconnected robots has emerged from earlier concepts related to Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS), and several 'open or 'hybrid' reference architectures exist which assist developers of robot control software and hardware to move beyond traditional, earlier notions of 'closed' robot control systems have been proposed.

[ 52 ] When implemented in real-time, such techniques can potentially improve the stability and performance of robots operating in unknown or uncertain environments by enabling the control systems to learn and adapt to environmental changes. [ 54 ] There are several examples of reference architectures for robot controllers, and also examples of successful implementations of actual robot controllers developed from them. One example of a generic reference architecture and associated interconnected, open-architecture robot and controller implementation was used in a number of research and development studies, including prototype implementation of novel advanced and intelligent control and environment mapping methods in real-time. [ 54 ] [ 55 ] A definition of robotic manipulation has been provided by Matt Mason as: \"manipulation refers to an agent's control of its environment through selective contact\".

Some have a fixed manipulator that cannot be replaced, while a few have one very general-purpose manipulator, for example, a humanoid hand. [ 59 ] For simplicity, most mobile robots have four wheels or a number of continuous tracks . Some researchers have tried to create more complex wheeled robots with only one or two wheels. These can have certain advantages such as greater efficiency and reduced parts, as well as allowing a robot to navigate in confined places that a four-wheeled robot would not be able to. Balancing robots generally use a gyroscope to detect how much a robot is falling and then drive the wheels proportionally in the same direction, to counterbalance the fall at hundreds of times per second, based on the dynamics of an inverted pendulum . [ 60 ] Many different balancing robots have been designed. [ 61 ] While the Segway is not commonly thought of as a robot, it can be thought of as a component of a robot, when used as such Segway refer to them as RMP (Robotic Mobility Platform).

Several one-wheeled balancing robots have been designed recently, such as Carnegie Mellon University 's \" Ballbot \" which is the approximate height and width of a person, and Tohoku Gakuin University 's \"BallIP\". [ 63 ] Because of the long, thin shape and ability to maneuver in tight spaces, they have the potential to function better than other robots in environments with people. [ 64 ] Several attempts have been made in robots that are completely inside a spherical ball, either by spinning a weight inside the ball, [ 65 ] [ 66 ] or by rotating the outer shells of the sphere. [ 67 ] [ 68 ] These have also been referred to as an orb bot [ 69 ] or a ball bot.

Tracked wheels behave as if they were made of hundreds of wheels, therefore are very common for outdoor off-road robots, where the robot must drive on very rough terrain. However, they are difficult to use indoors such as on carpets and smooth floors. Examples include NASA's Urban Robot \"Urbie\". [ 72 ] Walking is a difficult and dynamic problem to solve.

[ 73 ] Many other robots have been built that walk on more than two legs, due to these robots being significantly easier to construct. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] Walking robots can be used for uneven terrains, which would provide better mobility and energy efficiency than other locomotion methods. Typically, robots on two legs can walk well on flat floors and can occasionally walk up stairs . None can walk over rocky, uneven terrain. Some of the methods which have been tried are: The zero moment point (ZMP) is the algorithm used by robots such as Honda 's ASIMO . The robot's onboard computer tries to keep the total inertial forces (the combination of Earth 's gravity and the acceleration and deceleration of walking), exactly opposed by the floor reaction force (the force of the floor pushing back on the robot's foot). In this way, the two forces cancel out, leaving no moment (force causing the robot to rotate and fall over).

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Automation has been achieved by various means including mechanical , hydraulic , pneumatic , electrical , electronic devices , and computers , usually in combination. Complicated systems, such as modern factories , airplanes , and ships typically use combinations of all of these techniques. The benefits of automation includes labor savings, reducing waste, savings in electricity costs, savings in material costs, and improvements to quality, accuracy, and precision. Automation includes the use of various equipment and control systems such as machinery , processes in factories , boilers , [ 3 ] and heat-treating ovens , switching on telephone networks , steering , stabilization of ships , aircraft and other applications and vehicles with reduced human intervention. [ 4 ] Examples range from a household thermostat controlling a boiler to a large industrial control system with tens of thousands of input measurements and output control signals. In the simplest type of an automatic control loop , a controller compares a measured value of a process with a desired set value and processes the resulting error signal to change some input to the process, in such a way that the process stays at its set point despite disturbances. This closed-loop control is an application of negative feedback to a system. The mathematical basis of control theory began in the 18th century and advanced rapidly in the 20th.

[ 26 ] [ 27 ] The centrifugal governor was adopted by James Watt for use on a steam engine in 1788 after Watt's partner Boulton saw one at a flour mill Boulton & Watt were building. [ 21 ] The governor could not actually hold a set speed; the engine would assume a new constant speed in response to load changes. The governor was able to handle smaller variations such as those caused by fluctuating heat load to the boiler. Also, there was a tendency for oscillation whenever there was a speed change. As a consequence, engines equipped with this governor were not suitable for operations requiring constant speed, such as cotton spinning. [ 21 ] Several improvements to the governor, plus improvements to valve cut-off timing on the steam engine, made the engine suitable for most industrial uses before the end of the 19th century. Advances in the steam engine stayed well ahead of science, both thermodynamics and control theory. [ 21 ] The governor received relatively little scientific attention until James Clerk Maxwell published a paper that established the beginning of a theoretical basis for understanding control theory. Relay logic was introduced with factory electrification , which underwent rapid adaptation from 1900 through the 1920s. Central electric power stations were also undergoing rapid growth and the operation of new high-pressure boilers, steam turbines and electrical substations created a great demand for instruments and controls.

Central electric power stations were also undergoing rapid growth and the operation of new high-pressure boilers, steam turbines and electrical substations created a great demand for instruments and controls. Central control rooms became common in the 1920s, but as late as the early 1930s, most process controls were on-off. Operators typically monitored charts drawn by recorders that plotted data from instruments. To make corrections, operators manually opened or closed valves or turned switches on or off. Control rooms also used color-coded lights to send signals to workers in the plant to manually make certain changes. [ 28 ] The development of the electronic amplifier during the 1920s, which was important for long-distance telephony, required a higher signal-to-noise ratio, which was solved by negative feedback noise cancellation. This and other telephony applications contributed to the control theory. In the 1940s and 1950s, German mathematician Irmgard Flügge-Lotz developed the theory of discontinuous automatic controls, which found military applications during the Second World War to fire control systems and aircraft navigation systems . [ 6 ] Controllers, which were able to make calculated changes in response to deviations from a set point rather than on-off control, began being introduced in the 1930s. Controllers allowed manufacturing to continue showing productivity gains to offset the declining influence of factory electrification. [ 29 ] Factory productivity was greatly increased by electrification in the 1920s. U.S. manufacturing productivity growth fell from 5.2%/yr 1919–29 to 2.76%/yr 1929–41. Alexander Field notes that spending on non-medical instruments increased significantly from 1929 to 1933 and remained strong thereafter.

Other key advances in automatic controls include differential equations , stability theory and system theory (1938), frequency domain analysis (1940), ship control (1950), and stochastic analysis (1941). Starting in 1958, various systems based on solid-state [ 30 ] [ 31 ] digital logic modules for hard-wired programmed logic controllers (the predecessors of programmable logic controllers [PLC]) emerged to replace electro-mechanical relay logic in industrial control systems for process control and automation, including early Telefunken / AEG Logistat , Siemens Simatic , Philips / Mullard / Valvo [ de ] Norbit , BBC Sigmatronic , ACEC Logacec , Akkord [ de ] Estacord , Krone Mibakron, Bistat, Datapac, Norlog, SSR, or Procontic systems. [ 30 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] In 1959 Texaco 's Port Arthur Refinery became the first chemical plant to use digital control . [ 37 ] Conversion of factories to digital control began to spread rapidly in the 1970s as the price of computer hardware fell. The automatic telephone switchboard was introduced in 1892 along with dial telephones. By 1929, 31.9% of the Bell system was automatic. [ 38 ] : 158 Automatic telephone switching originally used vacuum tube amplifiers and electro-mechanical switches, which consumed a large amount of electricity.

The first commercially successful glass bottle-blowing machine was an automatic model introduced in 1905. [ 40 ] The machine, operated by a two-man crew working 12-hour shifts, could produce 17,280 bottles in 24 hours, compared to 2,880 bottles made by a crew of six men and boys working in a shop for a day. The cost of making bottles by machine was 10 to 12 cents per gross compared to $1.80 per gross by the manual glassblowers and helpers. Sectional electric drives were developed using control theory. Sectional electric drives are used on different sections of a machine where a precise differential must be maintained between the sections. In steel rolling, the metal elongates as it passes through pairs of rollers, which must run at successively faster speeds. In paper making paper, the sheet shrinks as it passes around steam-heated drying arranged in groups, which must run at successively slower speeds. The first application of a sectional electric drive was on a paper machine in 1919. [ 41 ] One of the most important developments in the steel industry during the 20th century was continuous wide strip rolling, developed by Armco in 1928. [ 42 ] Before automation, many chemicals were made in batches. In 1930, with the widespread use of instruments and the emerging use of controllers, the founder of Dow Chemical Co. was advocating continuous production . [ 43 ] Self-acting machine tools that displaced hand dexterity so they could be operated by boys and unskilled laborers were developed by James Nasmyth in the 1840s. ["

[ 44 ] Machine tools were automated with Numerical control (NC) using punched paper tape in the 1950s. This soon evolved into computerized numerical control (CNC). Today extensive automation is practiced in practically every type of manufacturing and assembly process. Some of the larger processes include electrical power generation, oil refining, chemicals, steel mills, plastics, cement plants, fertilizer plants, pulp and paper mills, automobile and truck assembly, aircraft production, glass manufacturing, natural gas separation plants, food and beverage processing, canning and bottling and manufacture of various kinds of parts. Robots are especially useful in hazardous applications like automobile spray painting. Robots are also used to assemble electronic circuit boards. Automotive welding is done with robots and automatic welders are used in applications like pipelines. With the advent of the space age in 1957, controls design, particularly in the United States, turned away from the frequency-domain techniques of classical control theory and backed into the differential equation techniques of the late 19th century, which were couched in the time domain. During the 1940s and 1950s, German mathematician Irmgard Flugge-Lotz developed the theory of discontinuous automatic control, which became widely used in hysteresis control systems such as navigation systems , fire-control systems , and electronics . Through Flugge-Lotz and others, the modern era saw time-domain design for nonlinear systems (1961), navigation (1960), optimal control and estimation theory (1962), nonlinear control theory (1969), digital control and filtering theory (1974), and the personal computer (1983).

Perhaps the most cited advantage of automation in industry is that it is associated with faster production and cheaper labor costs. Another benefit could be that it replaces hard, physical, or monotonous work. [ 45 ] Additionally, tasks that take place in hazardous environments or that are otherwise beyond human capabilities can be done by machines, as machines can operate even under extreme temperatures or in atmospheres that are radioactive or toxic. They can also be maintained with simple quality checks. However, at the time being, not all tasks can be automated, and some tasks are more expensive to automate than others. Initial costs of installing the machinery in factory settings are high, and failure to maintain a system could result in the loss of the product itself. Moreover, some studies seem to indicate that industrial automation could impose ill effects beyond operational concerns, including worker displacement due to systemic loss of employment and compounded environmental damage; however, these findings are both convoluted and controversial in nature, and could potentially be circumvented. [ 46 ] The main advantages of automation are: Automation primarily describes machines replacing human action, but it is also loosely associated with mechanization, machines replacing human labor. Coupled with mechanization, extending human capabilities in terms of size, strength, speed, endurance, visual range & acuity, hearing frequency & precision, electromagnetic sensing & effecting, etc., advantages include: [ 48 ] The main disadvantages of automation are: The paradox of automation says that the more efficient the automated system, the more crucial the human contribution of the operators.

Humans are less involved, but their involvement becomes more critical. Lisanne Bainbridge , a cognitive psychologist, identified these issues notably in her widely cited paper \" Ironies of Automation .\" [ 49 ] If an automated system has an error, it will multiply that error until it is fixed or shut down. This is where human operators come in. [ 50 ] A fatal example of this was Air France Flight 447 , where a failure of automation put the pilots into a manual situation they were not prepared for. [ 51 ] Many roles for humans in industrial processes presently lie beyond the scope of automation. Human-level pattern recognition , language comprehension , and language production ability are well beyond the capabilities of modern mechanical and computer systems (but see Watson computer ). Tasks requiring subjective assessment or synthesis of complex sensory data, such as scents and sounds, as well as high-level tasks such as strategic planning, currently require human expertise. In many cases, the use of humans is more cost-effective than mechanical approaches even where the automation of industrial tasks is possible. Therefore, algorithmic management as the digital rationalization of human labor instead of its substitution has emerged as an alternative technological strategy.

Early in the Industrial Revolution , when inventions like the steam engine were making some job categories expendable, workers forcefully resisted these changes. Luddites , for instance, were English textile workers who protested the introduction of weaving machines by destroying them. [ 55 ] More recently, some residents of Chandler, Arizona , have slashed tires and pelted rocks at a self-driving car , in protest over the cars' perceived threat to human safety and job prospects. [ 56 ] The relative anxiety about automation reflected in opinion polls seems to correlate closely with the strength of organized labor in that region or nation. For example, while a study by the Pew Research Center indicated that 72% of Americans are worried about increasing automation in the workplace, 80% of Swedes see automation and artificial intelligence (AI) as a good thing, due to the country's still-powerful unions and a more robust national safety net . [ 57 ] According to one estimate, 47% of all current jobs in the US have the potential to be fully automated by 2033. [ 58 ] Furthermore, wages and educational attainment appear to be strongly negatively correlated with an occupation's risk of being automated. [ 58 ] Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee argue that \"there's never been a better time to be a worker with special skills or the right education, because these people can use technology to create and capture value.

[ 60 ] According to a 2020 study in the Journal of Political Economy , automation has robust negative effects on employment and wages: \"One more robot per thousand workers reduces the employment-to-population ratio by 0.2 percentage points and wages by 0.42%.\" [ 61 ] A 2025 study in the American Economic Journal found that the introduction of industrial robots reduced 1993 and 2014 led to reduced employment of men and women by 3.7 and 1.6 percentage points.

[ 1 ] Specialists in the field are known as biotechnologists . The term biotechnology was first used by Károly Ereky in 1919 [ 2 ] to refer to the production of products from raw materials with the aid of living organisms. The core principle of biotechnology involves harnessing biological systems and organisms, such as bacteria , yeast , and plants, to perform specific tasks or produce valuable substances. Biotechnology has had a significant impact on many areas of society, from medicine to agriculture to environmental science . One of the key techniques used in biotechnology is genetic engineering , which allows scientists to modify the genetic makeup of organisms to achieve desired outcomes. This can involve inserting genes from one organism into another, and consequently, creating new traits or modifying existing ones. [ 3 ] Other important techniques used in biotechnology include tissue culture, which allows researchers to grow cells and tissues in the lab for research and medical purposes, and fermentation , which is used to produce a wide range of products such as beer, wine, and cheese. The applications of biotechnology are diverse and have led to the development of products like life-saving drugs, biofuels , genetically modified crops, and innovative materials.

As a result, there is ongoing debate and regulation surrounding the use and application of biotechnology in various industries and fields. [ 5 ] Biotechnology encompasses a wide range of procedures for modifying living organisms for human purposes, going back to domestication of animals, the cultivation of plants, and \"improvements\" to these through breeding programs that employ artificial selection and hybridization . Modern usage also includes genetic engineering, as well as cell and tissue culture technologies. The American Chemical Society defines biotechnology as the application of biological organisms, systems, or processes by various industries to learning about the science of life and the improvement of the value of materials and organisms, such as pharmaceuticals, crops, and livestock . [ 6 ] As per the European Federation of Biotechnology , biotechnology is the integration of natural science and organisms, cells, parts thereof, and molecular analogues for products and services.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] The utilization of biological processes, organisms or systems to produce products that are anticipated to improve human lives is termed biotechnology. [ 12 ] By contrast, bioengineering is generally thought of as a related field that more heavily emphasizes higher systems approaches (not necessarily the altering or using of biological materials directly ) for interfacing with and utilizing living things. Bioengineering is the application of the principles of engineering and natural sciences to tissues, cells, and molecules. This can be considered as the use of knowledge from working with and manipulating biology to achieve a result that can improve functions in plants and animals.

[ citation needed ] Agriculture has been theorized to have become the dominant way of producing food since the Neolithic Revolution . Through early biotechnology, the earliest farmers selected and bred the best-suited crops (e.g., those with the highest yields) to produce enough food to support a growing population. As crops and fields became increasingly large and difficult to maintain, it was discovered that specific organisms and their by-products could effectively fertilize , restore nitrogen , and control pests . Throughout the history of agriculture, farmers have inadvertently altered the genetics of their crops through introducing them to new environments and breeding them with other plants — one of the first forms of biotechnology.

[ 14 ] These processes were introduced in early Mesopotamia , Egypt , China and India , and still use the same basic biological methods. In brewing , malted grains (containing enzymes ) convert starch from grains into sugar and then adding specific yeasts to produce beer. In this process, carbohydrates in the grains broke down into alcohols, such as ethanol. Later, other cultures developed the process of lactic acid fermentation , which produced other preserved foods, such as soy sauce .

Darwin added to that body of work with his scientific observations about the ability of science to change species. These accounts contributed to Darwin's theory of natural selection. [ 15 ] For thousands of years, humans have used selective breeding to improve the production of crops and livestock to use them for food. In selective breeding, organisms with desirable characteristics are mated to produce offspring with the same characteristics. For example, this technique was used with corn to produce the largest and sweetest crops. [ 16 ] In the early twentieth century scientists gained a greater understanding of microbiology and explored ways of manufacturing specific products. In 1917, Chaim Weizmann first used a pure microbiological culture in an industrial process, that of manufacturing corn starch using Clostridium acetobutylicum , to produce acetone , which the United Kingdom desperately needed to manufacture explosives during World War I .

Calif. at San Francisco) and Stanley N. Cohen (Stanford) significantly advanced the new technology in 1972 by transferring genetic material into a bacterium, such that the imported material would be reproduced.

By increasing farm productivity, biotechnology boosts biofuel production. [ 32 ] Biotechnology has applications in four major industrial areas, including health care (medical), crop production and agriculture, non-food (industrial) uses of crops and other products (e.g., biodegradable plastics , vegetable oil , biofuels ), and environmental uses. [ 33 ] For example, one application of biotechnology is the directed use of microorganisms for the manufacture of organic products (examples include beer and milk products). Another example is using naturally present bacteria by the mining industry in bioleaching . [ 34 ] Biotechnology is also used to recycle, treat waste, clean up sites contaminated by industrial activities ( bioremediation ), and also to produce biological weapons . A series of derived terms have been coined to identify several branches of biotechnology, for example: In medicine, modern biotechnology has many applications in areas such as pharmaceutical drug discoveries and production, pharmacogenomics , and genetic testing (or genetic screening ). In 2021, nearly 40% of the total company value of pharmaceutical biotech companies worldwide were active in Oncology with Neurology and Rare Diseases being the other two big applications. [ 45 ] Pharmacogenomics (a combination of pharmacology and genomics ) is the technology that analyses how genetic makeup affects an individual's response to drugs. [ 46 ] Researchers in the field investigate the influence of genetic variation on drug responses in patients by correlating gene expression or single-nucleotide polymorphisms with a drug's efficacy or toxicity . [ 47 ] The purpose of pharmacogenomics is to develop rational means to optimize drug therapy, with respect to the patients' genotype , to ensure maximum efficacy with minimal adverse effects .

[ 49 ] [ 50 ] Biotechnology has contributed to the discovery and manufacturing of traditional small molecule pharmaceutical drugs as well as drugs that are the product of biotechnology – biopharmaceutics . Modern biotechnology can be used to manufacture existing medicines relatively easily and cheaply. The first genetically engineered products were medicines designed to treat human diseases. To cite one example, in 1978 Genentech developed synthetic humanized insulin by joining its gene with a plasmid vector inserted into the bacterium Escherichia coli . Insulin, widely used for the treatment of diabetes, was previously extracted from the pancreas of abattoir animals (cattle or pigs). The genetically engineered bacteria are able to produce large quantities of synthetic human insulin at relatively low cost. [ 51 ] [ 52 ] Biotechnology has also enabled emerging therapeutics like gene therapy . The application of biotechnology to basic science (for example through the Human Genome Project ) has also dramatically improved our understanding of biology and as our scientific knowledge of normal and disease biology has increased, our ability to develop new medicines to treat previously untreatable diseases has increased as well.

In addition to studying chromosomes to the level of individual genes, genetic testing in a broader sense includes biochemical tests for the possible presence of genetic diseases, or mutant forms of genes associated with increased risk of developing genetic disorders. Genetic testing identifies changes in chromosomes , genes, or proteins. [ 53 ] Most of the time, testing is used to find changes that are associated with inherited disorders. The results of a genetic test can confirm or rule out a suspected genetic condition or help determine a person's chance of developing or passing on a genetic disorder . As of 2011 several hundred genetic tests were in use. [ 54 ] [ 55 ] Since genetic testing may open up ethical or psychological problems, genetic testing is often accompanied by genetic counseling . Genetically modified crops (\"GM crops\", or \"biotech crops\") are plants used in agriculture , the DNA of which has been modified with genetic engineering techniques. In most cases, the main aim is to introduce a new trait that does not occur naturally in the species. Biotechnology firms can contribute to future food security by improving the nutrition and viability of urban agriculture . Furthermore, the protection of intellectual property rights encourages private sector investment in agrobiotechnology.

They are the earliest type of cell in a cell lineage . [ 1 ] They are found in both embryonic and adult organisms, but they have slightly different properties in each. They are usually distinguished from progenitor cells , which cannot divide indefinitely, and precursor or blast cells, which are usually committed to differentiating into one cell type. In mammals , roughly 50 to 150 cells make up the inner cell mass during the blastocyst stage of embryonic development , around days 5–14. These have stem-cell capability. In vivo , they eventually differentiate into all of the body's cell types (making them pluripotent ). This process starts with the differentiation into the three germ layers – the ectoderm , mesoderm and endoderm – at the gastrulation stage. However, when they are isolated and cultured in vitro , they can be kept in the stem-cell stage and are known as embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Adult stem cells are found in a few select locations in the body, known as niches , such as those in the bone marrow or gonads . They exist to replenish rapidly lost cell types and are multipotent or unipotent, meaning they only differentiate into a few cell types or one type of cell. In mammals, they include, among others, hematopoietic stem cells , which replenish blood and immune cells, basal cells , which maintain the skin epithelium , and mesenchymal stem cells , which maintain bone, cartilage , muscle and fat cells.

Since 1998 however, it has been possible to culture and differentiate human embryonic stem cells (in stem-cell lines ). The process of isolating these cells has been controversial , because it typically results in the destruction of the embryo. Sources for isolating ESCs have been restricted in some European countries and Canada, but others such as the UK and China have promoted the research.

[ 8 ] The key properties of a stem cell were first defined by Ernest McCulloch and James Till at the University of Toronto 's Faculty of Medicine and the Ontario Cancer Institute in the early 1960s. They discovered the blood-forming stem cell, the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC), through their pioneering work in mice. McCulloch and Till began a series of experiments in which bone marrow cells were injected into irradiated mice. They observed lumps in the spleens of the mice that were linearly proportional to the number of bone marrow cells injected. They hypothesized that each lump (colony) was a clone arising from a single marrow cell (stem cell). In subsequent work, McCulloch and Till, joined by graduate student Andrew John Becker and senior scientist Louis Siminovitch , confirmed that each lump did in fact arise from a single cell. Their results were published in Nature in 1963. In that same year, Siminovitch was a lead investigator for studies that found colony-forming cells were capable of self-renewal, which is a key defining property of stem cells that Till and McCulloch had theorized.

This allowed the formation of murine genetic models, a system in which the genes of mice are deleted or altered in order to study their function in pathology. In 1991, a process that allowed the human stem cell to be isolated was patented by Ann Tsukamoto. By 1998, human embryonic stem cells were first isolated by American biologist James Thomson , which made it possible to have new transplantation methods or various cell types for testing new treatments. In 2006, Shinya Yamanaka 's team in Kyoto, Japan converted fibroblasts into pluripotent stem cells by modifying the expression of only four genes. The feat represents the origin of induced pluripotent stem cells, known as iPS cells. [ 7 ] In 2011, a female maned wolf , run over by a truck, underwent stem cell treatment at the Zoo Brasília [ pt ] , this being the first recorded case of the use of stem cells to heal injuries in a wild animal. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] The classical definition of a stem cell requires that it possesses two properties: Two mechanisms ensure that a stem cell population is maintained (does not shrink in size): 1.

When a stem cell self-renews, it divides and disrupts the undifferentiated state. This self-renewal demands control of cell cycle as well as upkeep of multipotency or pluripotency, which all depends on the stem cell. [ 13 ] H. Stem cells use telomerase , a protein that restores telomeres , to protect their DNA and extend their cell division limit (the Hayflick limit ). [ 14 ] Potency specifies the differentiation potential (the potential to differentiate into different cell types) of the stem cell. [ 15 ] In practice, stem cells are identified by whether they can regenerate tissue. For example, the defining test for bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is the ability to transplant the cells and save an individual without HSCs. This demonstrates that the cells can produce new blood cells over a long term. It should also be possible to isolate stem cells from the transplanted individual, which can themselves be transplanted into another individual without HSCs, demonstrating that the stem cell was able to self-renew. Properties of stem cells can be illustrated in vitro , using methods such as clonogenic assays , in which single cells are assessed for their ability to differentiate and self-renew.

[ 20 ] Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are the cells of the inner cell mass of a blastocyst , formed prior to implantation in the uterus. [ 21 ] In human embryonic development the blastocyst stage is reached 4–5 days after fertilization , at which time it consists of 50–150 cells. ESCs are pluripotent and give rise during development to all derivatives of the three germ layers : ectoderm , endoderm and mesoderm . In other words, they can develop into each of the more than 200 cell types of the adult body when given sufficient and necessary stimulation for a specific cell type. They do not contribute to the extraembryonic membranes or to the placenta . During embryonic development the cells of the inner cell mass continuously divide and become more specialized. For example, a portion of the ectoderm in the dorsal part of the embryo specializes as ' neurectoderm ', which will become the future central nervous system (CNS). [ 22 ] Later in development, neurulation causes the neurectoderm to form the neural tube . At the neural tube stage, the anterior portion undergoes encephalization to generate or 'pattern' the basic form of the brain. At this stage of development, the principal cell type of the CNS is considered a neural stem cell .

These cells transition to a neurogenic state and start to divide asymmetrically to produce a large diversity of many different neuron types, each with unique gene expression, morphological, and functional characteristics. The process of generating neurons from radial glial cells is called neurogenesis . The radial glial cell, has a distinctive bipolar morphology with highly elongated processes spanning the thickness of the neural tube wall. It shares some glial characteristics, most notably the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). [ 23 ] [ 24 ] The radial glial cell is the primary neural stem cell of the developing vertebrate CNS, and its cell body resides in the ventricular zone , adjacent to the developing ventricular system . Neural stem cells are committed to the neuronal lineages ( neurons , astrocytes , and oligodendrocytes ), and thus their potency is restricted. [ 22 ] Nearly all research to date has made use of mouse embryonic stem cells (mES) or human embryonic stem cells (hES) derived from the early inner cell mass. Both have the essential stem cell characteristics, yet they require very different environments in order to maintain an undifferentiated state. Mouse ES cells are grown on a layer of gelatin as an extracellular matrix (for support) and require the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in serum media.

[ 26 ] Without optimal culture conditions or genetic manipulation, [ 27 ] embryonic stem cells will rapidly differentiate. A human embryonic stem cell is also defined by the expression of several transcription factors and cell surface proteins. The transcription factors Oct-4 , Nanog , and Sox2 form the core regulatory network that ensures the suppression of genes that lead to differentiation and the maintenance of pluripotency. [ 28 ] The cell surface antigens most commonly used to identify hES cells are the glycolipids stage specific embryonic antigen 3 and 4, and the keratan sulfate antigens Tra-1-60 and Tra-1-81. The molecular definition of a stem cell includes many more proteins and continues to be a topic of research. [ 29 ] By using human embryonic stem cells to produce specialized cells like nerve cells or heart cells in the lab, scientists can gain access to adult human cells without taking tissue from patients. They can then study these specialized adult cells in detail to try to discern complications of diseases, or to study cell reactions to proposed new drugs.

[ 32 ] Differentiating ES cells into usable cells while avoiding transplant rejection are just a few of the hurdles that embryonic stem cell researchers still face. [ 33 ] Embryonic stem cells, being pluripotent, require specific signals for correct differentiation – if injected directly into another body, ES cells will differentiate into many different types of cells, causing a teratoma . Many nations currently have moratoria or limitations on either human ES cell research or the production of new human ES cell lines due to their ethical controversies. The use of embryonic stem cells has generated significant ethical and political controversy. Central to the debate is the moral status of the human embryo, as deriving ES typically involves the destruction of early-stage embryos. Critics argue that this practice violates the sanctity of human life, and therefore is unacceptable.

[ 34 ] Where the mesoderm layer provides an increase to the body's skeletal elements, such as relating to the cartilage or bone. The term \"meso\" means middle, infusion originated from the Greek, signifying that mesenchymal cells are able to range and travel in early embryonic growth among the ectodermal and endodermal layers. This mechanism helps with space-filling thus, key for repairing wounds in adult organisms that have to do with mesenchymal cells in the dermis (skin), bone, or muscle.

Since they are easily isolated and obtain high yield, high plasticity, which makes able to facilitate inflammation and encourage cell growth, cell differentiation, and restoring tissue derived from immunomodulation and immunosuppression. MSC comes from the bone marrow, which requires an aggressive procedure when it comes to isolating the quantity and quality of the isolated cell, and it varies by how old the donor. When comparing the rates of MSC in the bone marrow aspirates and bone marrow stroma, the aspirates tend to have lower rates of MSC than the stroma.

[ 36 ] Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have the ability to divide indefinitely while keeping their pluripotency , which is made possible through specialized mechanisms of cell cycle control. [ 37 ] Compared to proliferating somatic cells , ESCs have unique cell cycle characteristics—such as rapid cell division caused by shortened G1 phase , absent G0 phase , and modifications in cell cycle checkpoints —which leaves the cells mostly in S phase at any given time. [ 37 ] [ 38 ] ESCs' rapid division is demonstrated by their short doubling time, which ranges from 8 to 10 hours, whereas somatic cells have doubling time of approximately 20 hours or longer. [ 39 ] As cells differentiate, these properties change: G1 and G2 phases lengthen, leading to longer cell division cycles. This suggests that a specific cell cycle structure may contribute to the establishment of pluripotency. [ 37 ] Particularly because G1 phase is the phase in which cells have increased sensitivity to differentiation, shortened G1 is one of the key characteristics of ESCs and plays an important role in maintaining undifferentiated phenotype . Although the exact molecular mechanism remains only partially understood, several studies have shown insight on how ESCs progress through G1—and potentially other phases—so rapidly.

[ 39 ] Foundational insight into the distinctive regulation of ESC cell cycle was gained by studies on mouse ESCs (mESCs). [ 38 ] mESCs showed a cell cycle with highly abbreviated G1 phase, which enabled cells to rapidly alternate between M phase and S phase. In a somatic cell cycle, oscillatory activity of Cyclin-Cdk complexes is observed in sequential action, which controls crucial regulators of the cell cycle to induce unidirectional transitions between phases: Cyclin D and Cdk4/6 are active in the G1 phase, while Cyclin E and Cdk2 are active during the late G1 phase and S phase; and Cyclin A and Cdk2 are active in the S phase and G2, while Cyclin B and Cdk1 are active in G2 and M phase. [ 39 ] However, in mESCs, this typically ordered and oscillatory activity of Cyclin-Cdk complexes is absent. Rather, the Cyclin E/Cdk2 complex is constitutively active throughout the cycle, keeping retinoblastoma protein (pRb) hyperphosphorylated and thus inactive. This allows for direct transition from M phase to the late G1 phase, leading to absence of D-type cyclins and therefore a shortened G1 phase. [ 38 ] Cdk2 activity is crucial for both cell cycle regulation and cell-fate decisions in mESCs; downregulation of Cdk2 activity prolongs G1 phase progression, establishes a somatic cell-like cell cycle, and induces expression of differentiation markers. [ 40 ] In human ESCs (hESCs), the duration of G1 is dramatically shortened. This has been attributed to high mRNA levels of G1-related Cyclin D2 and Cdk4 genes and low levels of cell cycle"

This has been attributed to high mRNA levels of G1-related Cyclin D2 and Cdk4 genes and low levels of cell cycle regulatory proteins that inhibit cell cycle progression at G1, such as p21 CipP1 , p27 Kip1 , and p57 Kip2 . [ 37 ] [ 41 ] Furthermore, regulators of Cdk4 and Cdk6 activity, such as members of the Ink family of inhibitors (p15, p16, p18, and p19), are expressed at low levels or not at all. Thus, similar to mESCs, hESCs show high Cdk activity, with Cdk2 exhibiting the highest kinase activity. Also similar to mESCs, hESCs demonstrate the importance of Cdk2 in G1 phase regulation by showing that G1 to S transition is delayed when Cdk2 activity is inhibited and G1 is arrest when Cdk2 is knocked down. [ 37 ] However unlike mESCs, hESCs have a functional G1 phase. hESCs show that the activities of Cyclin E/Cdk2 and Cyclin A/Cdk2 complexes are cell cycle-dependent and the Rb checkpoint in G1 is functional. [ 39 ] ESCs are also characterized by G1 checkpoint non-functionality, even though the G1 checkpoint is crucial for maintaining genomic stability. In response to DNA damage , ESCs do not stop in G1 to repair DNA damages but instead, depend on S and G2/M checkpoints or undergo apoptosis. The absence of G1 checkpoint in ESCs allows for the removal of cells with damaged DNA, hence avoiding potential mutations from inaccurate DNA repair.

In the field of biotechnology , cloning is the process of creating cloned organisms of cells and of DNA fragments. The artificial cloning of organisms, sometimes known as reproductive cloning, is often accomplished via somatic-cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), a cloning method in which a viable embryo is created from a somatic cell and an egg cell . In 1996, Dolly the sheep achieved notoriety for being the first mammal cloned from an adult somatic cell. [ 1 ] Another example of artificial cloning is molecular cloning , a technique in molecular biology in which a single living cell is used to clone a large population of cells that contain identical DNA molecules. In bioethics , there are a variety of ethical positions regarding the practice and possibilities of cloning . The use of embryonic stem cells , which can be produced through SCNT, in some stem cell research has attracted controversy . Cloning has been proposed as a means of reviving extinct species . In popular culture, the concept of cloning—particularly human cloning—is often depicted in science fiction ; depictions commonly involve themes related to identity, the recreation of historical figures or extinct species, or cloning for exploitation (e.g. cloning soldiers for warfare).

Natural cloning is the production of clones without the involvement of genetic engineering techniques or human intervention (i.e. artificial cloning).

Cloning is commonly used to amplify DNA fragments containing whole genes , but it can also be used to amplify any DNA sequence such as promoters , non-coding sequences and randomly fragmented DNA. It is used in a wide array of biological experiments and practical applications ranging from genetic fingerprinting to large scale protein production. Occasionally, the term cloning is misleadingly used to refer to the identification of the chromosomal location of a gene associated with a particular phenotype of interest, such as in positional cloning . In practice, localization of the gene to a chromosome or genomic region does not necessarily enable one to isolate or amplify the relevant genomic sequence. To amplify any DNA sequence in a living organism, that sequence must be linked to an origin of replication , which is a sequence of DNA capable of directing the propagation of itself and any linked sequence. However, a number of other features are needed, and a variety of specialised cloning vectors (small piece of DNA into which a foreign DNA fragment can be inserted) exist that allow protein production , affinity tagging , single-stranded RNA or DNA production and a host of other molecular biology tools.

Subsequently, a ligation procedure is used where the amplified fragment is inserted into a vector (piece of DNA). The vector (which is frequently circular) is linearised using restriction enzymes , and incubated with the fragment of interest under appropriate conditions with an enzyme called DNA ligase . Following ligation, the vector with the insert of interest is transfected into cells. A number of alternative techniques are available, such as chemical sensitisation of cells, electroporation , optical injection and biolistics . Finally, the transfected cells are cultured. As the aforementioned procedures are of particularly low efficiency, there is a need to identify the cells that have been successfully transfected with the vector construct containing the desired insertion sequence in the required orientation. Modern cloning vectors include selectable antibiotic resistance markers, which allow only cells in which the vector has been transfected, to grow. Additionally, the cloning vectors may contain colour selection markers, which provide blue/white screening (alpha-factor complementation) on X-gal medium. Nevertheless, these selection steps do not absolutely guarantee that the DNA insert is present in the cells obtained. Further investigation of the resulting colonies must be required to confirm that cloning was successful.

However, in the case of cell cultures from multi-cellular organisms, cell cloning is an arduous task as these cells will not readily grow in standard media. A useful tissue culture technique used to clone distinct lineages of cell lines involves the use of cloning rings (cylinders). [ 14 ] In this technique a single-cell suspension of cells that have been exposed to a mutagenic agent or drug used to drive selection is plated at high dilution to create isolated colonies, each arising from a single and potentially clonal distinct cell. At an early growth stage when colonies consist of only a few cells, sterile polystyrene rings (cloning rings), which have been dipped in grease, are placed over an individual colony and a small amount of trypsin is added. Cloned cells are collected from inside the ring and transferred to a new vessel for further growth. Somatic-cell nuclear transfer , popularly known as SCNT, can also be used to create embryos for research or therapeutic purposes. The most likely purpose for this is to produce embryos for use in stem cell research . This process is also called \"research cloning\" or \"therapeutic cloning\".

While a clonal human blastocyst has been created, stem cell lines are yet to be isolated from a clonal source. [ 15 ] Therapeutic cloning is achieved by creating embryonic stem cells in the hopes of treating diseases such as diabetes and Alzheimer's. The process begins by removing the nucleus (containing the DNA) from an egg cell and inserting a nucleus from the adult cell to be cloned. [ 16 ] In the case of someone with Alzheimer's disease, the nucleus from a skin cell of that patient is placed into an empty egg. The reprogrammed cell begins to develop into an embryo because the egg reacts with the transferred nucleus. The embryo will become genetically identical to the patient. [ 16 ] The embryo will then form a blastocyst which has the potential to form/become any cell in the body. [ 17 ] The reason why SCNT is used for cloning is because somatic cells can be easily acquired and cultured in the lab. This process can either add or delete specific genomes of farm animals. A key point to remember is that cloning is achieved when the oocyte maintains its normal functions and instead of using sperm and egg genomes to replicate, the donor's somatic cell nucleus is inserted into the oocyte. [ 18 ] The oocyte will react to the somatic cell nucleus, the same way it would to a sperm cell's nucleus.

[ 18 ] The hardest part of SCNT is removing maternal DNA from an oocyte at metaphase II. Once this has been done, the somatic nucleus can be inserted into an egg cytoplasm. [ 18 ] This creates a one-cell embryo. The grouped somatic cell and egg cytoplasm are then introduced to an electrical current. [ 18 ] This energy will hopefully allow the cloned embryo to begin development. The successfully developed embryos are then placed in surrogate recipients, such as a cow or sheep in the case of farm animals. [ 18 ] SCNT is seen as a good method for producing agriculture animals for food consumption. It successfully cloned sheep, cattle, goats, and pigs. Another benefit is SCNT is seen as a solution to clone endangered species that are on the verge of going extinct. [ 18 ] However, stresses placed on both the egg cell and the introduced nucleus can be enormous, which led to a high loss in resulting cells in early research. For example, the cloned sheep Dolly was born after 277 eggs were used for SCNT, which created 29 viable embryos. Only three of these embryos survived until birth, and only one survived to adulthood.

However, by 2014 researchers were reporting cloning success rates of seven to eight out of ten [ 20 ] and in 2016, a Korean Company Sooam Biotech was reported to be producing 500 cloned embryos per day. [ 21 ] In SCNT, not all of the donor cell's genetic information is transferred, as the donor cell's mitochondria that contain their own mitochondrial DNA are left behind. The resulting hybrid cells retain those mitochondrial structures which originally belonged to the egg. As a consequence, clones such as Dolly that are born from SCNT are not perfect copies of the donor of the nucleus. Organism cloning (also called reproductive cloning) refers to the procedure of creating a new multicellular organism, genetically identical to another. In essence this form of cloning is an asexual method of reproduction, where fertilization or inter-gamete contact does not take place. Asexual reproduction is a naturally occurring phenomenon in many species, including most plants and some insects. Scientists have made some major achievements with cloning, including the asexual reproduction of sheep and cows. There is a lot of ethical debate over whether or not cloning should be used.

Many horticultural plant cultivars are clones, having been derived from a single individual, multiplied by some process other than sexual reproduction. [ 23 ] As an example, some European cultivars of grapes represent clones that have been propagated for over two millennia. Other examples are potatoes and bananas. [ 24 ] Grafting can be regarded as cloning, since all the shoots and branches coming from the graft are genetically a clone of a single individual, but this particular kind of cloning has not come under ethical scrutiny and is generally treated as an entirely different kind of operation. Many trees, shrubs , vines , ferns and other herbaceous perennials form clonal colonies naturally. Parts of an individual plant may become detached by fragmentation and grow on to become separate clonal individuals. A common example is in the vegetative reproduction of moss and liverwort gametophyte clones by means of gemmae . Some vascular plants e.g. dandelion and certain viviparous grasses also form seeds asexually, termed apomixis , resulting in clonal populations of genetically identical individuals. Clonal derivation exists in nature in some animal species and is referred to as parthenogenesis (reproduction of an organism by itself without a mate). This is an asexual form of reproduction that is only found in females of some insects, crustaceans, nematodes, [ 25 ] fish (for example the hammerhead shark [ 26 ] ), Cape honeybees , [ 27 ] and lizards including the Komodo dragon [ 26 ] and several whiptails .

In species that use the XY sex-determination system , the offspring will always be female. An example of partenogenesis is the little fire ant ( Wasmannia auropunctata ), which is native to Central and South America but has spread throughout many tropical environments. Artificial cloning of organisms may also be called reproductive cloning . Hans Spemann , a German embryologist was awarded a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1935 for his discovery of the effect now known as embryonic induction, exercised by various parts of the embryo, that directs the development of groups of cells into particular tissues and organs. In 1924 he and his student, Hilde Mangold , were the first to perform somatic-cell nuclear transfer using amphibian embryos – one of the first steps towards cloning. [ 28 ] Reproductive cloning generally uses \" somatic cell nuclear transfer \" (SCNT) to create animals that are genetically identical. This process entails the transfer of a nucleus from a donor adult cell (somatic cell) to an egg from which the nucleus has been removed, or to a cell from a blastocyst from which the nucleus has been removed.

Additionally, the mitochondria in the cytoplasm also contains DNA and during SCNT this mitochondrial DNA is wholly from the cytoplasmic donor's egg, thus the mitochondrial genome is not the same as that of the nucleus donor cell from which it was produced. This may have important implications for cross-species nuclear transfer in which nuclear-mitochondrial incompatibilities may lead to death. Artificial embryo splitting or embryo twinning , a technique that creates monozygotic twins from a single embryo, is not considered in the same fashion as other methods of cloning. During that procedure, a donor embryo is split in two distinct embryos, that can then be transferred via embryo transfer . It is optimally performed at the 6- to 8-cell stage, where it can be used as an expansion of IVF to increase the number of available embryos. [ 30 ] If both embryos are successful, it gives rise to monozygotic (identical) twins . Dolly , a Finn-Dorset ewe , was the first mammal to have been successfully cloned from an adult somatic cell.

Sometimes, the term antibiotic —literally \"opposing life\", from the Greek roots ἀντι anti , \"against\" and βίος bios , \"life\"—is broadly used to refer to any substance used against microbes , but in the usual medical usage, antibiotics (such as penicillin ) are those produced naturally (by one microorganism fighting another), whereas non-antibiotic antibacterials (such as sulfonamides and antiseptics ) are fully synthetic . However, both classes have the same effect of killing or preventing the growth of microorganisms, and both are included in antimicrobial chemotherapy . \"Antibacterials\" include bactericides , bacteriostatics , antibacterial soaps , and chemical disinfectants , whereas antibiotics are an important class of antibacterials used more specifically in medicine [ 6 ] and sometimes in livestock feed . The earliest use of antibiotics was found in northern Sudan , where ancient Sudanese societies as early as 350–550 CE were systematically consuming antibiotics as part of their diet.

Armelagos , biological anthropologist [ 9 ] In other ancient civilizations, including Egypt, China, Serbia, Greece, and Rome, later evidence shows topical application of moldy bread to treat infections. [ 10 ] The first person to directly document the use of molds to treat infections was John Parkinson (1567–1650). Antibiotics revolutionized medicine in the 20th century. Synthetic antibiotic chemotherapy as a science and the development of antibacterials began in Germany with Paul Ehrlich in the late 1880s. [ 11 ] Alexander Fleming (1881–1955) discovered modern-day penicillin in 1928, the widespread use of which proved significantly beneficial during wartime. The first sulfonamide and the first systemically active antibacterial drug, Prontosil , was developed by a research team led by Gerhard Domagk in 1932 or 1933 at the Bayer Laboratories of the IG Farben conglomerate in Germany.

In current usage, the term \"antibiotic\" is applied to any medication that kills bacteria or inhibits their growth, regardless of whether that medication is produced by a microorganism or not. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] The term \"antibiotic\" derives from anti + βιωτικός ( biōtikos ), \"fit for life, lively\", [ 29 ] which comes from βίωσις ( biōsis ), \"way of life\", [ 30 ] and that from βίος ( bios ), \"life\".

Topical use is also one of the treatment options for some skin conditions including acne and cellulitis . [ 42 ] Advantages of topical application include achieving high and sustained concentration of antibiotic at the site of infection; reducing the potential for systemic absorption and toxicity, and total volumes of antibiotic required are reduced, thereby also reducing the risk of antibiotic misuse.

Some systemic absorption of the antibiotic may occur; the quantity of antibiotic applied is difficult to accurately dose, and there is also the possibility of local hypersensitivity reactions or contact dermatitis occurring.

[ 68 ] These findings are based on laboratory studies, and in clinical settings have also been shown to eliminate bacterial infection. [ 67 ] [ 69 ] Since the activity of antibacterials depends frequently on its concentration, [ 70 ] in vitro characterization of antibacterial activity commonly includes the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration of an antibacterial. [ 67 ] [ 71 ] To predict clinical outcome, the antimicrobial activity of an antibacterial is usually combined with its pharmacokinetic profile, and several pharmacological parameters are used as markers of drug efficacy. [ 72 ] In important infectious diseases, including tuberculosis, combination therapy (i.e., the concurrent application of two or more antibiotics) has been used to delay or prevent the emergence of resistance. In acute bacterial infections, antibiotics as part of combination therapy are prescribed for their synergistic effects to improve treatment outcome as the combined effect of both antibiotics is better than their individual effect.

[ 73 ] For example, chloramphenicol and tetracyclines are antagonists to penicillins . However, this can vary depending on the species of bacteria. [ 77 ] In general, combinations of a bacteriostatic antibiotic and bactericidal antibiotic are antagonistic. [ 73 ] [ 74 ] In addition to combining one antibiotic with another, antibiotics are sometimes co-administered with resistance-modifying agents. For example, β-lactam antibiotics may be used in combination with β-lactamase inhibitors , such as clavulanic acid or sulbactam , when a patient is infected with a β-lactamase -producing strain of bacteria. [ 78 ] Antibiotics are commonly classified based on their mechanism of action , chemical structure , or spectrum of activity. Most target bacterial functions or growth processes. [ 11 ] Those that target the bacterial cell wall ( penicillins and cephalosporins ) or the cell membrane ( polymyxins ), or interfere with essential bacterial enzymes ( rifamycins , lipiarmycins , quinolones , and sulfonamides ) have bactericidal activities, killing the bacteria.

Following a 40-year break in discovering classes of antibacterial compounds, four new classes of antibiotics were introduced to clinical use in the late 2000s and early 2010s: cyclic lipopeptides (such as daptomycin ), glycylcyclines (such as tigecycline ), oxazolidinones (such as linezolid ), and lipiarmycins (such as fidaxomicin ).

Jakobida are a small group (~20 species) of free-living heterotrophic flagellates, with two cilia, that primarily eat bacteria through suspension feeding; most are aquatic aerobes, with some anaerobic species, found in marine, brackish or fresh water.

Various short-lived organizations of anthropologists had already been formed. The Société Ethnologique de Paris , the first to use the term ethnology , was formed in 1839 and focused on methodically studying human races.

Darwin himself arrived at his conclusions through comparison of species he had seen in agronomy and in the wild. Darwin and Wallace unveiled evolution in the late 1850s. There was an immediate rush to bring it into the social sciences. Paul Broca in Paris was in the process of breaking away from the Société de biologie to form the first of the explicitly anthropological societies, the Société d'Anthropologie de Paris , meeting for the first time in Paris in 1859.

The title was soon translated as \"The Anthropology of Primitive Peoples\". The last two volumes were published posthumously. Waitz defined anthropology as \"the science of the nature of man\". Following Broca's lead, Waitz points out that anthropology is a new field, which would gather material from other fields, but would differ from them in the use of comparative anatomy, physiology, and psychology to differentiate man from \"the animals nearest to him\". He stresses that the data of comparison must be empirical, gathered by experimentation. [ 12 ] The history of civilization, as well as ethnology, are to be brought into the comparison. It is to be presumed fundamentally that the species, man, is a unity, and that \"the same laws of thought are applicable to all men\". [ 13 ] Waitz was influential among British ethnologists. In 1863, the explorer Richard Francis Burton and the speech therapist James Hunt broke away from the Ethnological Society of London to form the Anthropological Society of London , which henceforward would follow the path of the new anthropology rather than just ethnology. It was the 2nd society dedicated to general anthropology in existence. Representatives from the French Société were present, though not Broca. In his keynote address, printed in the first volume of its new publication, The Anthropological Review , Hunt stressed the work of Waitz, adopting his definitions as a standard.

The majority of these were evolutionists. One notable exception was the Berlin Society for Anthropology, Ethnology, and Prehistory (1869) founded by Rudolph Virchow , known for his vituperative attacks on the evolutionists. Not religious himself, he insisted that Darwin's conclusions lacked empirical foundation. During the last three decades of the 19th century, a proliferation of anthropological societies and associations occurred, most independent, most publishing their own journals, and all international in membership and association. The major theorists belonged to these organizations. They supported the gradual osmosis of anthropology curricula into the major institutions of higher learning. By 1898, 48 educational institutions in 13 countries had some curriculum in anthropology. None of the 75 faculty members were under a department named anthropology.

[ 17 ] Since the work of Franz Boas and Bronisław Malinowski in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, social anthropology in Great Britain and cultural anthropology in the US have been distinguished from other social sciences by their emphasis on cross-cultural comparisons , long-term in-depth examination of context, and the importance they place on participant-observation or experiential immersion in the area of research. Cultural anthropology, in particular, has emphasized cultural relativism , holism , and the use of findings to frame cultural critiques. [ 18 ] This has been particularly prominent in the United States, from Boas' arguments against 19th-century racial ideology , through Margaret Mead 's advocacy for gender equality and sexual liberation, to current criticisms of post-colonial oppression and promotion of multiculturalism .

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] In Great Britain and the Commonwealth countries, the British tradition of social anthropology tends to dominate. In the United States, anthropology has traditionally been divided into the four field approach developed by Franz Boas in the early 20th century: biological or physical anthropology ; social , cultural , or sociocultural anthropology ; archaeological anthropology ; and linguistic anthropology . These fields frequently overlap but tend to use different methodologies and techniques. [ 22 ] European countries with overseas colonies tended to practice more ethnology (a term coined and defined by Adam F. Kollár in 1783). It is sometimes referred to as sociocultural anthropology in the parts of the world that were influenced by the European tradition. [ 23 ] Anthropology is a global discipline involving humanities, social sciences and natural sciences. Anthropology builds upon knowledge from natural sciences , including the discoveries about the origin and evolution of Homo sapiens , human physical traits, human behavior , the variations among different groups of humans, how the evolutionary past of Homo sapiens has influenced its social organization and culture, and from social sciences , including the organization of human social and cultural relations, institutions, social conflicts, etc. [ 24 ] [ 25 ] Early anthropology originated in Classical Greece and Persia and studied and tried to understand observable cultural diversity.

According to Clifford Geertz , ...anthropology is perhaps the last of the great nineteenth-century conglomerate disciplines still for the most part organizationally intact. Long after natural history, moral philosophy, philology, and political economy have dissolved into their specialized successors, it has remained a diffuse assemblage of ethnology, human biology, comparative linguistics, and prehistory, held together mainly by the vested interests, sunk costs, and administrative habits of academia, and by a romantic image of comprehensive scholarship. [ 29 ] Sociocultural anthropology has been heavily influenced by structuralist and postmodern theories, as well as a shift toward the analysis of modern societies. During the 1970s and 1990s, there was an epistemological shift away from the positivist traditions that had largely informed the discipline. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] During this shift, enduring questions about the nature and production of knowledge came to occupy a central place in cultural and social anthropology. In contrast, archaeology and biological anthropology remained largely positivist. Sociocultural anthropology draws together the principal axes of cultural anthropology and social anthropology . Cultural anthropology is the comparative study of the manifold ways in which people make sense of the world around them, while social anthropology is the study of the relationships among individuals and groups. Cultural anthropology is more related to philosophy , literature and the arts (how one's culture affects the experience for self and group, contributing to a more complete understanding of the people's knowledge, customs, and institutions), while social anthropology is more related to sociology and history.

[ 32 ] In that, it helps develop an understanding of social structures, typically of others and other populations (such as minorities, subgroups, dissidents, etc.). There is no hard-and-fast distinction between them, and these categories overlap to a considerable degree. Inquiry in sociocultural anthropology is guided in part by cultural relativism , the attempt to understand other societies in terms of their own cultural symbols and values. [ 19 ] Accepting other cultures in their own terms moderates reductionism in cross-cultural comparison. [ 33 ] This project is often accommodated in the field of ethnography . Ethnography can refer to both a methodology and the product of ethnographic research, i.e. an ethnographic monograph . As a methodology, ethnography is based upon long-term fieldwork within a community or other research site. Participant observation is one of the foundational methods of social and cultural anthropology. [ 34 ] Ethnology involves the systematic comparison of different cultures. The process of participant-observation can be especially helpful to understanding a culture from an emic (conceptual, vs. etic , or technical) point of view. The study of kinship and social organization is a central focus of sociocultural anthropology, as kinship is a human universal . Sociocultural anthropology also covers economic and political organization , law and conflict resolution, patterns of consumption and exchange, material culture, technology, infrastructure, gender relations, ethnicity, childrearing and socialization, religion, myth, symbols, values, etiquette, worldview, sports, music, nutrition, recreation, games, food, festivals, and language- which is also the object of study in linguistic anthropology"

Comparison across cultures is a key element of method in sociocultural anthropology, including the industrialized (and de-industrialized) West. The Standard Cross-Cultural Sample (SCCS) includes 186 such cultures. [ 35 ] Biological anthropology and physical anthropology are synonymous terms to describe anthropological research focused on the study of humans and other primates in their biological, evolutionary, and demographic dimensions. It examines the biological and social factors that have affected the evolution of humans and other primates, and that generate, maintain or change contemporary genetic and physiological variation. [ 36 ] Nineteenth- and twentieth-century America and Europe were formative periods for many scientific disciplines, and racism played a significant role in motivating certain avenues of research, including the early development of bioarchaeology. A major driver behind the field’s creation was the effort to “establish the intellectual superiority of the white race.” [ 37 ] When scientists determined that the remains they were studying belonged to Indigenous, enslaved, or otherwise socially marginalized people, they often treated those individuals not as human beings but as scientific specimens. [ 38 ] This racist foundation shaped attitudes for decades, reinforcing the belief among many anthropologists that they held inherent authority over the human remains and burial sites they encountered.

Archaeology is the study of the human past through its material remains. Artifacts, faunal remains, and human altered landscapes are evidence of the cultural and material lives of past societies. Archaeologists examine material remains in order to deduce patterns of past human behavior and cultural practices. Ethnoarchaeology is a type of archaeology that studies the practices and material remains of living human groups in order to gain a better understanding of the evidence left behind by past human groups, who are presumed to have lived in similar ways. [ 39 ] Linguistic anthropology (not to be confused with anthropological linguistics ) seeks to understand the processes of human communications, verbal and non-verbal, variation in language across time and space, the social uses of language, and the relationship between language and culture. [ 40 ] It is the branch of anthropology that brings linguistic methods to bear on anthropological problems, linking the analysis of linguistic forms and processes to the interpretation of sociocultural processes. Linguistic anthropologists often draw on related fields including sociolinguistics , pragmatics , cognitive linguistics , semiotics , discourse analysis , and narrative analysis.

He argues that the anthropologist must make his writing consistent with their understanding of literature and other theory but notes that ethnography may be of use to the anthropologists and the fields inform one another. [ 43 ] One of the central problems in the anthropology of art concerns the universality of 'art' as a cultural phenomenon. Several anthropologists have noted that the Western categories of 'painting', 'sculpture', or 'literature', conceived as independent artistic activities, do not exist, or exist in a significantly different form, in most non-Western contexts. [ 44 ] To surmount this difficulty, anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which, without exclusively being 'artistic', have certain evident 'aesthetic' qualities. Boas' Primitive Art , Claude Lévi-Strauss ' The Way of the Masks (1982) or Geertz's 'Art as Cultural System' (1983) are examples in this trend of transforming the anthropology of 'art' into an anthropology of culturally specific 'aesthetics'. Media anthropology emphasizes ethnographic studies as a means of understanding producers, audiences, and other cultural and social aspects of mass media. The types of ethnographic contexts explored range from contexts of media production (e.g., ethnographies of newsrooms in newspapers, journalists in the field, film production) to contexts of media reception, following audiences in their everyday responses to media.

The range of social scientific methods has also expanded, as social researchers draw upon a variety of qualitative and quantitative techniques. The linguistic and cultural turns of the mid-20th century, especially, have led to increasingly interpretative , hermeneutic , and philosophical approaches towards the analysis of society.

[ 30 ] : 10 Comte had earlier used the term social physics , but it had been subsequently appropriated by others, most notably the Belgian statistician Adolphe Quetelet . [ 31 ] Comte endeavored to unify history, psychology, and economics through the scientific understanding of social life. Writing shortly after the malaise of the French Revolution , he proposed that social ills could be remedied through sociological positivism , an epistemological approach outlined in the Course in Positive Philosophy (1830–1842), later included in A General View of Positivism (1848). Comte believed a positivist stage would mark the final era in the progression of human understanding, after conjectural theological and metaphysical phases. [ 32 ] In observing the circular dependence of theory and observation in science, and having classified the sciences, Comte may be regarded as the first philosopher of science in the modern sense of the term. [ 33 ] [ 34 ] Comte gave a powerful impetus to the development of sociology, an impetus that bore fruit in the later decades of the nineteenth century. To say this is certainly not to claim that French sociologists such as Durkheim were devoted disciples of the high priest of positivism.

It is estimated that he sold one million books in his lifetime, far more than any other sociologist at the time. [ 37 ] So strong was his influence that many other 19th-century thinkers, including Émile Durkheim , defined their ideas in relation to his.

Suicide is a case study of variations in suicide rates among Catholic and Protestant populations, and served to distinguish sociological analysis from psychology or philosophy. It also marked a major contribution to the theoretical concept of structural functionalism . By carefully examining suicide statistics in different police districts, he attempted to demonstrate that Catholic communities have a lower suicide rate than that of Protestants, something he attributed to social (as opposed to individual or psychological ) causes.

Sociology quickly evolved as an academic response to the perceived challenges of modernity , such as industrialization, urbanization, secularization , and the process of rationalization . [ 45 ] The field predominated in continental Europe , with British anthropology and statistics generally following on a separate trajectory. By the turn of the 20th century, however, many theorists were active in the English-speaking world . Few early sociologists were confined strictly to the subject, interacting also with economics, jurisprudence , psychology and philosophy, with theories being appropriated in a variety of different fields.

Together the works of these great classical sociologists suggest what Giddens has recently described as 'a multidimensional view of institutions of modernity' and which emphasises not only capitalism and industrialism as key institutions of modernity, but also 'surveillance' (meaning 'control of information and social supervision') and 'military power' (control of the means of violence in the context of the industrialisation of war).

An emphasis on empiricism and the scientific method is sought to provide a tested foundation for sociological research based on the assumption that the only authentic knowledge is scientific knowledge, and that such knowledge can only arrive by positive affirmation through scientific methodology.

The extent of antipositivist criticism has also diverged, with many rejecting the scientific method and others only seeking to amend it to reflect 20th-century developments in the philosophy of science. However, positivism (broadly understood as a scientific approach to the study of society) remains dominant in contemporary sociology, especially in the United States. [ 42 ] Loïc Wacquant distinguishes three major strains of positivism: Durkheimian , Logical, and Instrumental.

This approach eschews epistemological and metaphysical concerns (such as the nature of social facts) in favour of methodological clarity, replicability , reliability and validity . [ 66 ] This positivism is more or less synonymous with quantitative research , and so only resembles older positivism in practice. Since it carries no explicit philosophical commitment, its practitioners may not belong to any particular school of thought. Modern sociology of this type is often credited to Paul Lazarsfeld , [ 42 ] who pioneered large-scale survey studies and developed statistical techniques for analysing them. This approach lends itself to what Robert K. Merton called middle-range theory : abstract statements that generalize from segregated hypotheses and empirical regularities rather than starting with an abstract idea of a social whole.

[ 5 ] Integrating political studies of the past into a unified discipline is ongoing, and the history of political science has provided a rich field for the growth of both normative and positive political science, with each part of the discipline sharing some historical predecessors. The American Political Science Association and the American Political Science Review were founded in 1903 and 1906, respectively, in an effort to distinguish the study of politics from economics and other social phenomena. APSA membership rose from 204 in 1904 to 1,462 in 1915.

[ 7 ] In the 1950s and the 1960s, a behavioral revolution stressing the systematic and rigorously scientific study of individual and group behavior swept the discipline. A focus on studying political behavior, rather than institutions or interpretation of legal texts, characterized early behavioral political science, including work by Robert Dahl , Philip Converse , and in the collaboration between sociologist Paul Lazarsfeld and public opinion scholar Bernard Berelson .

[ 9 ] Some evolutionary psychology theories argue that humans have evolved a highly developed set of psychological mechanisms for dealing with politics. However, these mechanisms evolved for dealing with the small group politics that characterized the ancestral environment and not the much larger political structures in today's world. This is argued to explain many important features and systematic cognitive biases of current politics. [ 10 ] Political science is a social study concerning the allocation and transfer of power in decision making , the roles and systems of governance including governments and international organizations , political behaviour, and public policies . It measures the success of governance and specific policies by examining many factors, including stability , justice , material wealth , peace , and public health . Some political scientists seek to advance positive theses (which attempt to describe how things are, as opposed to how they should be) by analysing politics; others advance normative theses, such as by making specific policy recommendations.

According to Chaturvedy, Political scientists may serve as advisers to specific politicians, or even run for office as politicians themselves. Political scientists can be found working in governments, in political parties, or as civil servants. They may be involved with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) or political movements. In a variety of capacities, people educated and trained in political science can add value and expertise to corporations . Private enterprises such as think tanks , research institutes, polling and public relations firms often employ political scientists.

[ 21 ] Its applicability for early diagnosis of political crises was demonstrated by the analysis of the prolonged stress period preceding the 2014 Ukrainian economic and political crisis. There was a simultaneous increase in the total correlation between the 19 major public fears in the Ukrainian society (by about 64%) and in their statistical dispersion (by 29%) during the pre-crisis years.

[ 25 ] Citing this difficulty, former American Political Science Association President Lawrence Lowell once said \"We are limited by the impossibility of experiment. Politics is an observational, not an experimental science.\" [ 18 ] Because of this, political scientists have historically observed political elites, institutions, and individual or group behaviour in order to identify patterns, draw generalizations, and build theories of politics. Like all social sciences, political science faces the difficulty of observing human actors that can only be partially observed and who have the capacity for making conscious choices, unlike other subjects, such as non-human organisms in biology , minerals in geoscience , chemical elements in chemistry , stars in astronomy , or particles in physics . Despite the complexities, contemporary political science has progressed by adopting a variety of methods and theoretical approaches to understanding politics, and methodological pluralism is a defining feature of contemporary political science.

Political science may overlap with topics of study that are the traditional focuses of other social sciences—for example, when sociological norms or psychological biases are connected to political phenomena. In these cases, political science may either inherit their methods of study or develop a contrasting approach. [ 37 ] For example, Lisa Wedeen has argued that political science's approach to the idea of culture, originating with Gabriel Almond and Sidney Verba and exemplified by authors like Samuel P. Huntington , could benefit from aligning more closely with the study of culture in anthropology.

As a subdiscipline of political science, the focus of IR studies lies on the political, diplomatic, and security connections among states, as well as the study of modern international relations within the context of world history. In many academic institutions, studies of IR are thus situated in the department of politics/social sciences. This is, for example, the case in Scandinavia, where international relations are often simply referred to as international politics (IP).

Contrary to popular belief, Westphalia still embodied layered systems of sovereignty, especially within the Holy Roman Empire . [ 19 ] More than the Peace of Westphalia, the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713 is thought to reflect an emerging norm that sovereigns had no internal equals within a defined territory and no external superiors as the ultimate authority within the territory's sovereign borders. These principles underpin the modern international legal and political order. The period between roughly 1500 to 1789 saw the rise of independent sovereign states , multilateralism , and the institutionalization of diplomacy and the military. The French Revolution contributed the idea that it was the citizenry of a state, defined as the nation, that was sovereign, rather than a monarch or noble class. A state wherein the nation is sovereign would thence be termed a nation-state, as opposed to a monarchy or a religious state; the term republic increasingly became its synonym. An alternative model of the nation-state was developed in reaction to the French republican concept by the Germans and others, who, instead of giving the citizenry sovereignty, kept the princes and nobility, but defined nation-statehood in ethnic-linguistic terms, establishing the rarely, if ever, fulfilled ideal that all people speaking one language should belong to one state only. The same claim to sovereignty was made for both forms of nation-state. In Europe today, few states conform to either definition of nation-state: many continue to have royal sovereigns, and hardly any are ethnically homogeneous.

The particular European system supposing the sovereign equality of states was exported to the Americas, Africa, and Asia via colonialism and the \"standards of civilization\". The contemporary international system was finally established through decolonization during the Cold War . However, this is somewhat over-simplified. While the nation-state system is considered \"modern\", many states have not incorporated the system and are termed \"pre-modern\". A handful of states have moved beyond insistence on full sovereignty and can be considered \"post-modern\". The ability of contemporary IR discourse to explain the relations of these different types of states is disputed. \"Levels of analysis\" is a way of looking at the international system, which includes the individual level, the domestic state as a unit, the international level of transnational and intergovernmental affairs, and the global level. What is explicitly recognized as international relations theory was not developed until after World War I , and is dealt with in more detail below. IR theory, however, has a long tradition of drawing on the work of other social sciences . The use of capitalizations of the \"I\" and \"R\" in international relations aims to distinguish the academic discipline of international relations from the phenomena of international relations. Many cite Sun Tzu 's The Art of War (6th century BC), Thucydides ' History of the Peloponnesian War (5th century BC), Chanakya 's Arthashastra (4th century BC), as the inspiration for realist theory, with Hobbes ' Leviathan and Machiavelli 's The Prince providing further elaboration.

The lines between IR and other political science subfields are sometimes blurred, in particular when it comes to the study of conflict , institutions , political economy , and political behavior . [ 7 ] The division between comparative politics and international relations is artificial, as processes within nations shape international processes, and international processes shape processes within states.

[ 35 ] Within the study of international relations, there exist multiple theories seeking to explain how states and other actors operate within the international system. These can generally be divided into three main strands: realism, liberalism, and constructivism. [ 36 ] The realist framework of international relations rests on the fundamental assumption that the international state system is an anarchy , with no overarching power restricting the behaviour of sovereign states. As a consequence, states are engaged in a continuous power struggle, where they seek to augment their own military capabilities, economic power, and diplomacy relative to other states; this is to ensure the protection of their political system, citizens, and vital interests. [ 37 ] The realist framework further assumes that states act as unitary, rational actors, where central decision makers in the state apparatus ultimately stand for most of the state's foreign policy decisions.

[ 38 ] International organizations are in consequence merely seen as tools for individual states used to further their own interests, and are thought to have little power in shaping states' foreign policies on their own. [ 39 ] The realist framework is traditionally associated with the analysis of power politics, and has been used to analyze the conflicts between states in the early European state system; the causes of the First and Second World Wars , as well as the behavior of the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War . In settings such as these, the realist framework carries great interpretative insights in explaining how the military and economic power struggles of states lead to larger armed conflicts. History of the Peloponnesian War , written by Thucydides , is considered a foundational text of the realist school of political philosophy. [ 40 ] There is debate over whether Thucydides himself was a realist; Richard Ned Lebow has argued that seeing Thucydides as a realist is a misinterpretation of a more complex political message within his work.

To improve society, it is first necessary to understand the laws by which society lives. The operation of these laws being impervious to our preferences, persons will challenge them only at the risk of failure. Realism, believing as it does in the objectivity of the laws of politics, must also believe in the possibility of developing a rational theory that reflects, however imperfectly and one-sidedly, these objective laws. It also believes, then, in the possibility of distinguishing in politics between truth and opinion—between what is true objectively and rationally, supported by evidence and illuminated by reason, and what is only a subjective judgment, divorced from the facts as they are and informed by prejudice and wishful thinking. Major theorists include E. H. Carr , Robert Gilpin , Charles P. Kindleberger , Stephen D. Krasner , Hans Morgenthau , Kenneth Waltz , Robert Jervis , Stephen Walt , and John Mearsheimer . In contrast to realism, the liberal framework emphasises that states, although they are sovereign, do not exist in a purely anarchical system. Rather, liberal theory assumes that states are institutionally constrained by the power of international organisations and mutually dependent on one another through economic and diplomatic ties. Institutions such as the United Nations , the World Trade Organisation (WTO), and the International Court of Justice are taken to, over time, have developed power and influence to shape the foreign policies of individual states.

Furthermore, the existence of the globalised world economy makes continuous military power struggle irrational, as states are dependent on participation in the global trade system to ensure their own survival. As such, the liberal framework stresses cooperation between states as a fundamental part of the international system. States are not seen as unitary actors, but pluralistic arenas where interest groups, non-governmental organisations, and economic actors also shape the creation of foreign policy. [ 39 ] [ 43 ] The liberal framework is associated with the analysis of the globalised world as it emerged in the aftermath of World War II . Increased political cooperation through organisations such as the UN , as well as economic cooperation through institutions such as the WTO, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund , was thought to have made the realist analysis of power and conflict inadequate in explaining the workings of the international system. [ 44 ] Immanuel Kant 's essay Perpetual Peace from 1795 is often cited as the intellectual basis of liberal theory. In it, he postulates that states, over time, through increased political and economic cooperation, will come to resemble an international federation—a world government —which will be characterised by continual peace and cooperation. [ 45 ] In modern times, liberal international relations theory arose after World War I in response to the ability of states to control and limit war in their international relations.

A new version of \"idealism\" that focused on human rights as the basis of the legitimacy of international law was advanced by Hans Köchler . Major theorists include Montesquieu , Immanuel Kant , Michael W. Doyle , Francis Fukuyama , and Helen Milner . [ 47 ] Liberal institutionalism (sometimes referred to as neoliberalism) shows how cooperation can be achieved in international relations even if neorealist assumptions apply (states are the key actors in world politics, the international system is anarchic, and states pursue their self-interest). Liberal institutionalists highlight the role of international institutions and regimes in facilitating cooperation between states. [ 48 ] Prominent neoliberal institutionalists are John Ikenberry , Robert Keohane , and Joseph Nye . Robert Keohane's 1984 book After Hegemony used insights from the new institutional economics to argue that the international system could remain stable in the absence of a hegemon, thus rebutting hegemonic stability theory.

[ 1 ] Criminology is a multidisciplinary field in both the behavioural and social sciences , which draws primarily upon the research of sociologists , political scientists , economists , legal sociologists , psychologists , philosophers , psychiatrists , social workers , biologists , social anthropologists , scholars of law and jurisprudence , as well as the processes that define administration of justice and the criminal justice system. The interests of criminologists include the study of the nature of crime and criminals, origins of criminal law , etiology of crime, social reaction to crime, and the functioning of law enforcement agencies and the penal institutions. It can be broadly said that criminology directs its inquiries along three lines: first, it investigates the nature of criminal law and its administration and conditions under which it develops; second, it analyzes the causation of crime and the personality of criminals; and third, it studies the control of crime and the rehabilitation of offenders. Thus, criminology includes within its scope the activities of legislative bodies, law-enforcement agencies, judicial institutions, correctional institutions and educational, private and public social agencies. Modern academic criminology has direct roots in the 19th-century Italian School of \"criminal anthropology\", which according to the historian Mary Gibson \"caused a radical refocusing of criminological discussion throughout Europe and the United States from law to the criminal.

While this 'Italian School' was in turn attacked and partially supplanted in countries such as France by 'sociological' theories of delinquency, they retained the new focus on the criminal.\" [ 2 ] According to Gibson, the term criminology was most likely coined in 1885 by Italian law professor Raffaele Garofalo as Criminologia [ it ] . [ 2 ] In the late 19th century, French anthropologist Paul Topinard used the analogous French term Criminologie [ fr ] . [ 3 ] In the United States, criminology grew substantially as a discipline in the first quarter of the twentieth century. From 1900 to 2000 this field of research underwent three significant phases in the United States: (1) Golden Age of Research (1900–1930) which has been described as a multiple-factor approach, (2) Golden Age of Theory (1930–1960) which endeavored to show the limits of systematically connecting criminological research to theory, and (3) a 1960–2000 period, which was seen as a significant turning point for criminology. [ 4 ] [ failed verification ] During the post-1960s expansion of higher education, criminology in the United States began to institutionalize outside of sociology, particularly through the rapid development of standalone criminal justice programs.

[ 9 ] [ 5 ] [ 10 ] By the 1990s, the field had moved toward reconciliation, with many programs embracing a dual identity as Criminology/Criminal Justice. Despite early concerns about academic rigor, criminal justice majors became highly popular and financially attractive to universities, sometimes referred to as academic \"cash cows.\" [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Graduate education also expanded: by the end of the 1990s, there were more than 100 master’s-level programs and at least 25 Ph.D. programs in criminology and criminal justice across the country.

They also argue that criminal behavior is innate and within a person. Philosophers within this school applied the scientific method to study human behavior. Positivism comprises three segments: biological , psychological and social positivism . [ 24 ] Psychological Positivism is the concept that criminal acts or the people doing said crimes do them because of internal factors driving them. Social Positivism, which is often referred to as Sociological Positivism, discusses the thought process that criminals are produced by society. This school claims that low income levels, high poverty/unemployment rates, and poor educational systems create and motivate criminals. [ 25 ] The notion of having a criminal personality is achieved from the school of thought of psychological positivism. It essentially means that parts of an individual's personality have traits that align with many of those possessed by criminals, such as neuroticism, anti-social tendencies, aggressive behaviors, and other factors.

Criminologists have since rejected Lombroso's biological theories since control groups were not used in his studies.

Adolphe Quetelet used data and statistical analysis to study the relationship between crime and sociological factors.

Differential association (sub-cultural) posits that people learn crime through association . This theory was advocated by Edwin Sutherland , who focused on how \"a person becomes delinquent because of an excess of definitions favorable to violation of law over definitions unfavorable to violation of law.\" [ 44 ] Associating with people who may condone criminal conduct, or justify crime under specific circumstances makes one more likely to take that view, under his theory.

This thought can be associated or used within criminology, because it essentially takes the stance of defending criminals and criminal behaviors. The defense and argument lies in the thoughts that these people and their acts are not their faults but they are actually the result of society (i.e. unemployment, poverty, etc.), and these people are actually, in fact, behaving properly. [ 46 ] Chicago school sociologists adopted a social ecology approach to studying cities and postulated that urban neighborhoods with high levels of poverty often experience a breakdown in the social structure and institutions , such as family and schools. This results in social disorganization , which reduces the ability of these institutions to control behavior and creates an environment ripe for deviant behavior .

Shaw of the Chicago School. [ 48 ] Social disorganization theory postulates that neighborhoods plagued with poverty and economic deprivation tend to experience high rates of population turnover . [ 49 ] This theory suggests that crime and deviance is valued within groups in society, 'subcultures' or 'gangs'. These groups have different values to the social norm . These neighborhoods also tend to have high population heterogeneity . [ 49 ] With high turnover, informal social structure often fails to develop, which in turn makes it difficult to maintain social order in a community. [ citation needed ] Since the 1950s, social ecology studies have built on the social disorganization theories. Many studies have found that crime rates are associated with poverty, disorder, high numbers of abandoned buildings, and other signs of community deterioration. [ 49 ] [ 50 ] As working and middle-class people leave deteriorating neighborhoods, the most disadvantaged portions of the population may remain. William Julius Wilson suggested a poverty \"concentration effect\", which may cause neighborhoods to be isolated from the mainstream of society and become prone to violence.

[ 55 ] Such youths may be tempted to take up criminal activities, choosing an illegitimate path that provides them more lucrative economic benefits than conventional, over legal options such as minimum wage -paying jobs available to them. [ 55 ] Delinquency tends to occur among the lower-working-class males who have a lack of resources available to them and live in impoverished areas, as mentioned extensively by Albert Cohen (Cohen, 1965). Bias has been known to occur among law enforcement agencies, where officers tend to place a bias on minority groups, without knowing for sure if they had committed a crime or not.

Instead of looking for factors that make people become criminal, these theories try to explain why people do not become criminal. Travis Hirschi identified four main characteristics: \"attachment to others\", \"belief in moral validity of rules\", \"commitment to achievement\", and \"involvement in conventional activities\". [ 57 ] The more a person features those characteristics, the less likely he or she is to become deviant (or criminal). On the other hand, if these factors are not present, a person is more likely to become a criminal. Hirschi expanded on this theory with the idea that a person with low self-control is more likely to become criminal. As opposed to most criminology theories, these do not look at why people commit crime but rather why they do not commit crime. [ 58 ] A simple example: Someone wants a big yacht but does not have the means to buy one. If the person cannot exert self-control, he or she might try to get the yacht (or the means for it) in an illegal way, whereas someone with high self-control will (more likely) either wait, deny themselves of what want or seek an intelligent intermediate solution, such as joining a yacht club to use a yacht by group consolidation of resources without violating social norms.

Pedagogy, taken as an academic discipline, is the study of how knowledge and skills are imparted in an educational context, and it considers the interactions that take place during learning. Both the theory and practice of pedagogy vary greatly as they reflect different social, political, and cultural contexts. [ 1 ] Pedagogy is often described as the act of teaching. [ 2 ] The pedagogy adopted by teachers shapes their actions, judgments, and teaching strategies by taking into consideration theories of learning , understandings of students and their needs, and the backgrounds and interests of individual students. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Its aims may range from furthering liberal education (the general development of human potential) to the narrower specifics of vocational education (the imparting and acquisition of specific skills). Instructive strategies are governed by the pupil's background knowledge and experience, situation and environment, as well as learning goals set by the student and teacher. One example would be the Socratic method . [ 5 ] The meaning of the term \"pedagogy\" is often contested and a great variety of definitions has been suggested.

They include helping the student develop their intellectual and social abilities as well as psychomotor and affective learning, which are about developing practical skills and adequate emotional dispositions, respectively.

This approach is often based on the idea that the most central aspects of teaching are only acquired by practice and cannot be easily codified through scientific inquiry. [ 7 ] [ 12 ] In this regard, pedagogy is concerned with \"observing and refining one's skill as a teacher\". [ 12 ] A more inclusive definition combines these two characterizations and sees pedagogy both as the practice of teaching and the discourse and study of teaching methods. Some theorists give an even wider definition by including considerations such as \"the development of health and bodily fitness, social and moral welfare, ethics and aesthetics \".

[ 6 ] Due to this variety of meanings, it is sometimes suggested that pedagogy is a \"catch-all term\" associated with various issues of teaching and learning. In this sense, it lacks a precise definition. According to Patricia Murphy, a detailed reflection on the meaning of the term \"pedagogy\" is important nonetheless since different theorists often use it in very different ways. In some cases, non-trivial assumptions about the nature of learning are even included in its definition. [ 7 ] Pedagogy is often specifically understood in relation to school education. But in a wider sense, it includes all forms of education, both inside and outside schools. [ 12 ] In this wide sense, it is concerned with the process of teaching taking place between two parties: teachers and learners. The teacher's goal is to bring about certain experiences in the learner to foster their understanding of the subject matter to be taught. Pedagogy is interested in the forms and methods used to convey this understanding. [ 8 ] [ 7 ] Pedagogy is closely related to didactics but there are some differences. Usually, didactics is seen as the more limited term that refers mainly to the teacher's role and activities, i.e how their behavior is most beneficial to the process of education. This is one central aspect of pedagogy besides other aspects that consider the learner's perspective as well. In this wider sense, pedagogy focuses on \"any conscious activity by one person designed to enhance learning in another\".

The instructor in this learning environment recognizes the learners' need to think for themselves to facilitate their ability to think about problems and issues. [ 19 ] It was first described by Plato in the Socratic Dialogues . Plato (428/427 or 424/423 – 348/347 BCE) describes a system of education in The Republic (375 BCE) in which individual and family rights are sacrificed to the State. He describes three castes: one to learn a trade; one to learn literary and aesthetic ideas; and one to be trained in literary, aesthetic, scientific, and philosophical ideas. [ 20 ] Plato saw education as a fulfillment of the soul, and by fulfilling the soul the body subsequently benefited. Plato viewed physical education for all as a necessity to a stable society. [ 20 ] Aristotle (384–322 BCE) composed a treatise, On Education , which was subsequently lost. However, he renounced Plato's view in subsequent works, advocating for a common education mandated to all citizens by the State.

His motto was \"Learning by head, hand and heart\". [ 21 ] The educational philosophy and pedagogy of Johann Friedrich Herbart (4 May 1776 – 14 August 1841) highlighted the correlation between personal development and the resulting benefits to society. In other words, Herbart proposed that humans become fulfilled once they establish themselves as productive citizens. Herbartianism refers to the movement underpinned by Herbart's theoretical perspectives. [ 22 ] Referring to the teaching process, Herbart suggested five steps as crucial components. Specifically, these five steps include: preparation, presentation, association, generalization, and application.

In his eyes, the purpose of education should not revolve around the acquisition of a pre-determined set of skills, but rather the realization of one's full potential and the ability to use those skills for the greater good ( My Pedagogic Creed , Dewey, 1897). Dewey advocated for an educational structure that strikes a balance between delivering knowledge while also taking into account the interests and experiences of the student ( The Child and the Curriculum, Dewey, 1902). Dewey not only re-imagined the way that the learning process should take place but also the role that the teacher should play within that process. He envisioned a divergence from the mastery of a pre-selected set of skills to the cultivation of autonomy and critical-thinking within the teacher and student alike. Confucius (551–479 BCE) stated that authority has the responsibility to provide oral and written instruction to the people under the rule, and \"should do them good in every possible way.\" [ 20 ] One of the deepest teachings of Confucius may have been the superiority of personal exemplification over explicit rules of behavior. His moral teachings emphasized self-cultivation, emulation of moral exemplars, and the attainment of skilled judgement rather than knowledge of rules. Other relevant practices in the Confucian teaching tradition include the Rite and its notion of body-knowledge as well as Confucian understanding of the self, one that has a broader conceptualization than the Western individual self.

Decisions regarding the curriculum , disciplinary practices, student testing , textbook selection, the language used by the teacher, and more can empower or disempower students.

According to these scholars, schools nowadays are often dismissed as outdated or ineffective. Deschoolers even argue that schools rest on the false premise that schools are necessary for learning but that people learn faster or better outside the classroom. Others critique the fact that some teachers stand before a classroom with only six weeks of teacher education. [ 54 ] [ 55 ] [ 56 ] Against this background, Masschelein and Simons propose to look at school from a different point of view. Their educational morphology approaches the school as a particular scholastic 'form of gathering'. What the authors mean with that, is the following: school is a particular time-space-matter arrangement. This thus includes concretes architectures, technologies, practices and figures. This arrangement \"deals in a specific way with the new generation, allows for a particular relation to the world, and for a particular experience of potentiality and of commonality (of making things public)\". [ 57 ] Masschelein and Simons' most famous work is the book \"Looking after school: a critical analysis of personalisation in Education\". It takes a critical look at the main discourse of today's"

[ 57 ] Masschelein and Simons' most famous work is the book \"Looking after school: a critical analysis of personalisation in Education\". It takes a critical look at the main discourse of today's education. Education is seen through a socio-economic lens: education is aimed at mobilising talents and competencies (p23). This is seen in multiple texts from governing bodies, in Belgium and Europe. One of the most significant examples is quoted on page 23: Education and training can only contribute to growth and job-creation if learning is focused on the knowledge, skills and competences to be acquired by students (learning outcomes) through the learning process, rather than on completing a specific stage or on time spent in school. (European Commission, 2012, p.7) [ 58 ] This is, according to Masschelein and Simons a plea for learning outcomes and demonstrates a vision of education in which the institution is no longer the point of departure. The main ambition in this discourse of education is the efficient and effective realisation of learning outcomes for all. Things like the place and time of learning, didactic and pedagogic support are means to an end: the acquisition of preplanned learning outcomes. And these outcomes are a direct input for the knowledge economy. Masschelein and Simons' main critique here is that the main concern is not the educational institution (anymore). Rather, the focus lies on the learning processes and mainly on the learning outcomes of the individual learner. In Brazil, a pedagogue is a multidisciplinary educator. Undergraduate education in Pedagogy qualifies students to become school administrators or coordinators at all educational levels, and also to become multidisciplinary teachers, such as p"

Aided by translations of Greek texts, the Hellenistic worldview was preserved and absorbed into the Arabic -speaking Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age .

The history of science is often seen as a linear story of progress, [ 27 ] but historians have come to see the story as more complex.

Historians of science increasingly see their field as part of a global history of exchange, conflict and collaboration. [ 32 ] The relationship between science and religion has been variously characterized in terms of \"conflict\", \"harmony\", \"complexity\", and \"mutual independence\", among others.

Historians have emphasized [ 37 ] that trust is necessary for agreement on claims about nature. In this light, the 1660 establishment of the Royal Society and its code of experiment – trustworthy because witnessed by its members – has become an important chapter in the historiography of science. [ 38 ] Many people in modern history (typically women and persons of color) were excluded from elite scientific communities and characterized by the science establishment as inferior .

[ 49 ] [ 50 ] The oral tradition of preliterate societies had several features, the first of which was its fluidity. [ 2 ] New information was constantly absorbed and adjusted to new circumstances or community needs. There were no archives or reports. This fluidity was closely related to the practical need to explain and justify a present state of affairs. [ 2 ] Another feature was the tendency to describe the universe as just sky and earth, with a potential underworld . They were also prone to identify causes with beginnings, thereby providing a historical origin with an explanation. There was also a reliance on a \" medicine man \" or \" wise woman \" for healing, knowledge of divine or demonic causes of diseases, and in more extreme cases, for rituals such as exorcism , divination , songs, and incantations .

The Edwin Smith Papyrus , written at about the same time, contains a surgical manual for treating wounds, fractures, and dislocations. The Egyptians believed that the effectiveness of their medicines depended on the preparation and administration under appropriate rituals.

The antibiotic was in wide commercial use only in the mid 20th century. The theory states that earthen jars containing grain used for making beer contained the bacterium streptomyces , which produced tetracycline. Although Nubians were not aware of tetracycline, they could have noticed that people fared better by drinking beer than just consuming the grain itself. According to Charlie Bamforth, a professor of biochemistry and brewing science at the University of California, Davis, \"They must have consumed it because it was rather tastier than the grain from which it was derived.\" [ 61 ] Based on engraved plans of Meroitic King Amanikhabali 's pyramids, Nubians had a sophisticated understanding of mathematics as they appreciated the harmonic ratio.

Biology of non-human organisms was generally only written about in the context of mainstream academic disciplines. Animal physiology was studied extensively for the purpose of divination ; the anatomy of the liver , which was seen as an important organ in haruspicy , was studied in particularly intensive detail. Animal behavior was also studied for divinatory purposes. Most information about the training and domestication of animals was probably transmitted orally without being written down, but one text dealing with the training of horses has survived.

Babylonian astronomy was \"the first and highly successful attempt at giving a refined mathematical description of astronomical phenomena.\" According to the historian A. Aaboe, \"all subsequent varieties of scientific astronomy, in the Hellenistic world, in India, in Islam, and in the West—if not indeed all subsequent endeavour in the exact sciences—depend upon Babylonian astronomy in decisive and fundamental ways.\" [ 73 ] To the Babylonians and other Near Eastern cultures, messages from the gods or omens were concealed in all natural phenomena that could be deciphered and interpreted by those who are adept.

Before the modern age and worldwide spread of knowledge, written examples of new mathematical developments have come to light only in a few locales. From 3000 BC the Mesopotamian states of Sumer , Akkad and Assyria , followed closely by Ancient Egypt and the Levantine state of Ebla began using arithmetic , algebra and geometry for taxation , commerce , trade, and in astronomy , to record time and formulate calendars . The earliest mathematical texts available are from Mesopotamia and Egypt – Plimpton 322 ( Babylonian c. 2000 – 1900 BC), [ 2 ] the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus ( Egyptian c. 1800 BC) [ 3 ] and the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus (Egyptian c. 1890 BC). All these texts mention the so-called Pythagorean triples , so, by inference, the Pythagorean theorem seems to be the most ancient and widespread mathematical development, after basic arithmetic and geometry. The study of mathematics as a \"demonstrative discipline\" began in the 6th century BC with the Pythagoreans , who coined the term \"mathematics\" from the ancient Greek μάθημα ( mathema ), meaning \"subject of instruction\".

[ 25 ] The earliest evidence of written mathematics dates back to the ancient Sumerians , who built the earliest civilization in Mesopotamia. They developed a complex system of metrology from 3000 BC that was chiefly concerned with administrative/financial counting, such as grain allotments, workers, weights of silver, or even liquids, among other things. [ 26 ] From around 2500 BC onward, the Sumerians wrote multiplication tables on clay tablets and dealt with geometrical exercises and division problems. The earliest traces of the Babylonian numerals also date back to this period. [ 27 ] Babylonian mathematics was written using a sexagesimal (base-60) numeral system . [ 24 ] From this derives the modern-day usage of 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, and 360 (60 × 6) degrees in a circle, as well as the use of seconds and minutes of arc to denote fractions of a degree. It is thought the sexagesimal system was initially used by Sumerian scribes because 60 can be evenly divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20 and 30, [ 24 ] and for scribes (doling out the aforementioned grain allotments, recording weights of silver, etc.) being able to easily calculate by hand was essential, and so a sexagesimal system is pragmatically easier to calculate by hand with; however, there is the possibility that using"

[ 28 ] Also, unlike the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, the Babylonians had a place-value system, where digits written in the left column represented larger values, much as in the decimal system. The power of the Babylonian notational system lay in that it could be used to represent fractions as easily as whole numbers; thus, multiplying two numbers that contained fractions was no different from multiplying integers, similar to modern notation. The notational system of the Babylonians was the best of any civilization until the Renaissance , and its power allowed it to achieve remarkable computational accuracy; for example, the Babylonian tablet YBC 7289 gives an approximation of √ 2 accurate to five decimal places. [ 29 ] The Babylonians lacked, however, an equivalent of the decimal point, and so the place value of a symbol often had to be inferred from the context. [ 23 ] By the Seleucid period, the Babylonians had developed a zero symbol as a placeholder for empty positions; however, it was only used for intermediate positions. [ 23 ] This zero sign does not appear in terminal positions; thus, the Babylonians came close but did not develop a true place value system.

Greek mathematics of the period following Alexander the Great is sometimes called Hellenistic mathematics. [ 44 ] Greek mathematics was much more sophisticated than the mathematics that had been developed by earlier cultures. All surviving records of pre-Greek mathematics show the use of inductive reasoning , that is, repeated observations used to establish rules of thumb. Greek mathematicians, by contrast, used deductive reasoning . The Greeks used logic to derive conclusions from definitions and axioms, and used mathematical rigor to prove them. [ 45 ] Greek mathematics is thought to have begun with Thales of Miletus (c. 624–c.546 BC) and Pythagoras of Samos (c. 582–c. 507 BC). Although the extent of the influence is disputed, they were probably inspired by Egyptian and Babylonian mathematics . According to legend, Pythagoras traveled to Egypt to learn mathematics, geometry, and astronomy from Egyptian priests. Thales used geometry to solve problems such as calculating the height of pyramids and the distance of ships from the shore. He is credited with the first use of deductive reasoning applied to geometry, by deriving four corollaries to Thales' Theorem .

[ 72 ] He also coined the terminology in use today for conic sections, namely parabola (\"place beside\" or \"comparison\"), \"ellipse\" (\"deficiency\"), and \"hyperbola\" (\"a throw beyond\").

During the early 1st millennium BC, after the Akkadians, an empire called Assyria dominated the entire Middle East, stretching from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean Sea . Its cities were filled with impressive buildings and art. Assyrian art is best known for its detailed stone reliefs, depicting scenes of court life, religious practice, hunting and epic battles. These reliefs were initially painted in bright colours and placed in palaces. Besides their beauty, they also depict Assyrian life and views of the world, including Assyrian clothing and furniture. Later, the Babylonians conquered the Assyrian Empire. During the 6th century BC, Babylon became the largest city in the world. Upon entering Babylon, visitors were greeted with the impressive Ishtar Gate , with its walls covered in vivid blue glazed bricks and reliefs showing dragons, bulls and lions. This gate is named after Ishtar , the goddess of war and love.

Persepolis ( Iran ) was the capital of the empire, and it is full of impressive sculptures showing religious images and people of the empire. There are also the ruins of a palace here, with a big audience hall for receiving guests. Besides Mesopotamia and Iran, there were Ancient civilizations who produced art and architecture in other regions as well. In Anatolia (present-day Turkey ), the Hittite Empire appeared. During Antiquity, South Arabia was important in the production and trade of aromatics, bringing wealth to the kingdoms that were in this region. Before circa 4000 BC, the climate of Arabia was wetter than today. In south-west, several kingdoms appeared, like Saba’ . The south Arabian human figure is usually stylized, based on rectangular shapes, but with fine details. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] One of the first great civilizations arose in Egypt , which had elaborate and complex works of art produced by professional artists and craftspeople. Egypt's art was religious and symbolic. Given that the culture had a highly centralized power structure and hierarchy, a great deal of art was created to honour the pharaoh , including great monuments. Egyptian art and culture emphasized the religious concept of immortality. Later Egyptian art includes Coptic and Byzantine art. The architecture is characterized by monumental structures, built with large stone blocks, lintels, and solid columns . Funerary monuments included mastaba , tombs of rectangular form; pyramids , which included step pyramids ( Saqqarah ) or smooth-sided pyramids ( Giza ); and the hypogeum , underground tombs ( Valley of the Kings ).

Temples used pylons and trapezoid walls with hypaethros and hypostyle halls and shrines . The temples of Karnak , Luxor , Philae and Edfu are good examples. Another type of temple is the rock temple , in the form of a hypogeum , found in Abu Simbel and Deir el-Bahari . Painting of the Egyptian era used a juxtaposition of overlapping planes. The images were represented hierarchically, i.e., the Pharaoh is larger than the common subjects or enemies depicted at his side. Egyptians painted the outline of the head and limbs in profile, while the torso, hands, and eyes were painted from the front. Applied arts were developed in Egypt, in particular woodwork and metalwork . There are superb examples such as cedar furniture inlaid with ebony and ivory which can be seen in the tombs at the Egyptian Museum . Other examples include the pieces found in Tutankhamun 's tomb, which are of great artistic value.

Many stylized terracotta figurines have also been found in Harappan sites, and a few stone and bronze sculptures, more naturalistic than the ceramic ones. [ 24 ] The first metal objects produced in China were made almost 4000 years ago, during the Xia dynasty ( c. 2100–1700 BC). During the Chinese Bronze Age (the Shang and Zhou dynasties) court intercessions and communication with the spirit world were conducted by a shaman (possibly the king himself). In the Shang dynasty ( c. 1600–1050 BC), the supreme deity was Shangdi , but aristocratic families preferred to contact the spirits of their ancestors. They prepared elaborate banquets of food and drink for them, heated and served in bronze ritual vessels . These bronze vessels had many shapes, depending on their purpose: for wine, water, cereals or meat, and some of them were marked with readable characters, which shows the development of writing. This kind of vessels, of a very high quality and complexity, were discovered on the Valley of the Yellow River in the Henan province, in sites like Erlitou , Anyang or Zhengzhou . They were used in religious rituals to cement the Shang authority, and when the Shang capital fell, around 1050 BC, its conquerors, the Zhou ( c. 1050–156"

The Shang court had been accused of excessive drunkenness, and the Zhou, promoting the imperial Tian (\"Heaven\") as the prime spiritual force, rather than ancestors, limited wine in religious rites, in favour of food. The use of ritual bronzes continued into the early Han dynasty (206 BC–220 AD). One of the most commonly used motifs was the taotie , a stylized face divided centrally into two almost mirror-image halves, with nostrils, eyes, eyebrows, jaws, cheeks and horns, surrounded by incised patterns. Whether taotie represented real, mythological or wholly imaginary creatures cannot be determined. The enigmatic bronzes of Sanxingdui , near Guanghan (in Sichuan province ), are evidence for a mysterious sacrificial religious system unlike anything elsewhere in ancient China and quite different from the art of the contemporaneous Shang at Anyang . Excavations at Sanxingdui since 1986 have revealed four pits containing artefacts of bronze , jade and gold . There was found a great bronze statue of a human figure which stands on a plinth decorated with abstract elephant heads. Besides the standing figure, the first two pits contained over 50 bronze heads, some wearing headgear and three with a frontal covering of gold leaf .

Succeeding the Shang dynasty the Zhou dynasty (1050–221 BC) ruled more than any other one from Chinese history. Its last centuries were characterized by violence, the era being known as the Warring States period . During this troubling time, some philosophical movements appeared: Confucianism , Daoism and Legalism . The Warring States period was ended by Qinshi Huangdi , who united China in 221 BC. He ordered a huge tomb, guarded by the Terracotta Army . Another huge project was a predecessor of the Great Wall , erected for rejecting pillaging tribes from the north. After the death of the emperor, his dynasty, the Qin (221–206 BC), lasted only three years. Qinshi Huangdi was followed by the Han dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD), during which the Silk Road developed considerably, bringing new cultural influences in China. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] Through harmonious proportion and a focus on aesthetics, ancient Greek and Roman art became the foundation and inspiration of all Western art, being the standard to which most European artists aspired, until the 19th century. [ 30 ] The Latin poet Horace , writing in the age of Roman emperor Augustus (1st century BC to 1st century AD), famously remarked that although conquered on the battlefield, \"captive Greece overcame its savage conqueror and brought the arts to rustic Rome.\" The power of Greek art lies in its representation of the human figure and its focus on human beings and the anthropomorphic gods as chief subjects.

The artworks of the Greeks were meant to decorate temples and public buildings, to celebrate battle victories and remarkable personalities, and to commemorate the dead. They were also given as offerings to the gods. Although there was no definitive transition, the art is usually divided stylistically into the four periods of Geometric, Archaic, Classical and Hellenistic. During the Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), realism and idealism were delicately balanced. In comparison, the works of the earlier Geometric (9th to 8th centuries BC) and Archaic (7th to 6th centuries BC) ages can seem appear primitive, but these artists had different goals: naturalistic representation was not necessarily their aim. Greek artists built on the artistic foundations of Egypt, further developing the arts of sculpture, painting, architecture, and ceramics. Among the techniques they perfected include methods of carving and casting sculptures, fresco painting and building magnificent buildings. Roman art lovers collected ancient Greek originals, Roman replicas of Greek art, or newly created paintings and sculptures fashioned in a variety of Greek styles, thus preserving for posterity works of art otherwise lost. Wall and panel paintings, sculptures and mosaics decorated public spaces and private homes. Greek imagery also appeared on Roman jewellery, vessels of gold, silver, bronze and terracotta, and even on weapons and commercial weights.

[ 31 ] Since the advent of the Classical Age in Athens , in the 5th century BC, the Classical way of building has been deeply woven into Western understanding of architecture and, indeed, of civilization itself. [ 32 ] From circa 850 BC to circa 300 AD, ancient Greek culture flourished on the Greek mainland , on the Peloponnese , and on the Aegean islands. Five of the Wonders of the World were Greek: the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus , the Statue of Zeus at Olympia , the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus , the Colossus of Rhodes , and the Lighthouse of Alexandria . However, Ancient Greek architecture is best known for its temples , many of which are found throughout the region, and the Parthenon is a prime example of this. Later, they will serve as inspiration for Neoclassical architects during the late 18th and the 19th century. The most well-known temples are the Parthenon and the Erechtheion , both on the Acropolis of Athens . Another type of important Ancient Greek buildings were the theatres. Both temples and theatres used a complex mix of optical illusions and balanced ratios. Looking at the archaeological remains of ancient buildings it is easy to perceive them as limestone and concrete in a grey taupe tone and to make the assumption that ancient buildings were monochromatic. However, architecture was polychromed in much of the Ancient world.

Besides ancient temples, Medieval cathedrals were never completely white. Most had colored highlights on capitals and columns . [ 33 ] This practice of coloring buildings and artworks was abandoned during the early Renaissance. This is because Leonardo da Vinci and other Renaissance artists, including Michelangelo , promoted a color palette inspired by the ancient Greco-Roman ruins, which because of neglect and constant decay during the Middle Ages, became white despite being initially colorful. The pigments used in the ancient world were delicate and especially susceptible to weathering. Without necessary care, the colors exposed to rain, snow, dirt, and other factors, vanished over time, and this way Ancient buildings and artworks became white, like they are today and were during the Renaissance. [ 34 ] Celtic art, known for its intricate patterns, symbolic motifs, and distinctive designs, evolved over a long period, with its roots stretching back to the early Iron Age. This rich and diverse artistic tradition spans several centuries and regions, primarily encompassing what is today Ireland, Britain, France, and parts of Central and Eastern Europe. The history of Celtic art can be broken down into two key periods: [ 42 ] Hallstatt Culture (circa 800–500 BCE): The earliest recognizable form of Celtic art is associated with the Hallstatt culture, located in what is now Austria and surrounding regions. This period saw the development of distinctive metalworking techniques, especially in gold, bronze, and iron. Artifacts from this time often feature geometric patterns, stylized animal motifs, and abstract spirals. [ 43 ] La Tène Culture"

[ 43 ] La Tène Culture (circa 500 BCE – 1 CE): The La Tène culture is considered the height of early Celtic art. During this period, there was a significant increase in the complexity and intricacy of designs. Artisans in La Tène created weapons, jewelry, and everyday items adorned with swirling patterns, knotwork, and stylized animals. This era is also noted for the first significant use of the \"Celtic knot\", a form of endless loop design that symbolizes eternity and continuity. [ 44 ] No civilization has had an impact as enduring and powerful on Western art as the Roman Empire . The legacy of ancient Rome is evident through the medieval and early modern periods , and Roman art continues to be reused in the modern era in both traditionalist and postmodern artworks. [ 46 ] Sometimes it is viewed as derived from Greek precedents, but also has its own distinguishing features, some of them inherited from Etruscan art . Roman sculpture is often less idealized than its Greek precedents, being very realistic. Roman architecture often used concrete , and features such as the round arch and dome were invented. Luxury objects in metal-work , gem engraving , ivory carvings , and glass are sometimes considered in modern terms to be minor forms of Roman art, [ 47 ] although this would not necessarily have been the case for contemporaries.

The origins of music remain highly contentious; commentators often relate it to the origin of language , with much disagreement surrounding whether music arose before, after or simultaneously with language . Many theories have been proposed by scholars from a wide range of disciplines, though none has achieved broad approval. Most cultures have their own mythical origins concerning the invention of music, generally rooted in their respective mythological, religious or philosophical beliefs. The music of prehistoric cultures is first firmly dated to c. 38,000 BC of the Upper Paleolithic by evidence of bone flutes , though it remains unclear whether or not the actual origins lie in the earlier Middle Paleolithic period (300,000 to 50,000 BP ). There is little known about prehistoric music, with traces mainly limited to some simple flutes and percussion instruments. However, such evidence indicates that music existed to some extent in prehistoric societies such as the Xia dynasty and the Indus Valley civilisation . Upon the development of writing, the music of literate civilizations— ancient music —was present in the major Chinese, Egyptian, Greek, Indian, Persian, Mesopotamian, and Middle Eastern societies. It is difficult to make many generalizations about ancient music as a whole, but from what is known it was often characterized by monophony and improvisation . In ancient song forms, the texts were closely aligned with music, and though the oldest extant musical notation survives from this period, many texts survive without their accompanying music, such as the Rigveda and the Shijing Classic of Poetry .

Such interaction led to the Tang dynasty 's music being heavily influenced by Central Asian traditions, while the Tang dynasty's music, the Japanese gagaku and Korean court music each influenced each other. Historically, religions have often been catalysts for music. The Vedas of Hinduism immensely influenced Indian classical music , and the Five Classics of Confucianism laid the basis for subsequent Chinese music . Following the rapid spread of Islam in the 7th century, Islamic music dominated Persia and the Arab world, and the Islamic Golden Age saw the presence of numerous important music theorists. Music written for and by the early Christian Church properly inaugurates the Western classical music tradition, [ 1 ] which continues into medieval music where polyphony , staff notation and nascent forms of many modern instruments developed. In addition to religion or the lack thereof, a society's music is influenced by all other aspects of its culture, including social and economic organization and experience, climate, and access to technology. Many cultures have coupled music with other art forms, such as the Chinese four arts and the medieval quadrivium . The emotions and ideas that music expresses, the situations in which music is played and listened to, and the attitudes toward musicians and composers all vary between regions and periods.

Not all writings constitute literature . Some recorded materials, such as compilations of data (e.g., a check register ) are not considered literature, and this article relates only to the evolution of the works defined above. Early literature is derived from stories told in hunter-gatherer bands through oral tradition , including myth and folklore . Storytelling emerged as the human mind evolved to apply causal reasoning and structure events into a narrative and language , allowing early humans to share information with one another. Early storytelling provided opportunity to learn about dangers and social norms while also entertaining listeners. [ 1 ] Myth can be expanded to include all use of patterns and stories to make sense of the world, and it may be psychologically intrinsic to humans. Epic poetry is recognized as the pinnacle of ancient literature. These works are long narrative poems that recount the feats of mythic heroes, often said to take place in the nation's early history. [ 2 ] The history of writing began independently in different parts of the world, including in Mesopotamia about 3200 BC, in Ancient China about 1250 BC, and in Mesoamerica about 650 BC.

Sumerian literature did not use titles , instead being referred to by the work's first line.

[ 46 ] In the Roman Republic , literature took the form of tragedy, comedy, epic, and historical. Livius Andronicus is recognized as the originator of literature in the Latin language, and due to Rome's influence, the development of Latin literature often extended beyond the traditional boundaries of Rome. Plautus was an influential playwright known for his comedies that emphasized humor and popular culture . The late republic saw the rise of Augustan literature and Classical Latin , which was primarily prose and included the works of Cicero and Sallust . Upon the formation of the Roman Empire , political commentary declined and prose went out of favor to be replaced by poetry. Poets such as Virgil , Horace , Propertius , and Ovid are recognized as bringing about the Golden Age of Latin literature. [ 48 ] Virgil's epic poem the Aeneid closely followed the formula established by Homer.

After the fall of Rome (in roughly 476), many of the literary approaches and styles invented by the Greeks and Romans fell out of favor in Europe. In the millennium or so that intervened between Rome's fall and the Florentine Renaissance , medieval literature focused more and more on faith and faith-related matters, in part because the works written by the Greeks had not been preserved in Europe, and therefore there were few models of classical literature to learn from and move beyond. Although much had been lost to the ravages of time (and to catastrophe, as in the burning of the Library of Alexandria), many Greek works remained extant: they were preserved and copied carefully by Muslim scribes. What little there was became changed and distorted, with new forms beginning to develop from the distortions. Some of these distorted beginnings of new styles can be seen in the literature generally described as Matter of Rome , Matter of France and Matter of Britain .

The writings of Bede — Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum —and others continue the faith-based historical tradition begun by Eusebius in the early 4th century. Between Augustine and The Bible , religious authors had numerous aspects of Christianity that needed further explication and interpretation. Thomas Aquinas , more than any other single person, was able to turn theology into a kind of science, in part because he was heavily influenced by Aristotle, whose works were returning to Europe in the 13th century.

The advent of film as an artistic medium is not clearly defined. There were earlier cinematographic screenings by others like the first showing of life sized pictures in motion 1894 in Berlin by Ottomar Anschütz ; however, the commercial, public screening of ten Lumière brothers ' short films in Paris on 28 December 1895, can be regarded as the breakthrough of projected cinematographic motion pictures. The earliest films were in black and white, under a minute long, without recorded sound, and consisted of a single shot from a steady camera. The first decade saw film move from a novelty, to an established mass entertainment industry, with film production companies and studios established throughout the world. Conventions toward a general cinematic language developed, with film editing, camera movements and other cinematic techniques contributing specific roles in the narrative of films. Popular new media, including television (mainstream since the 1950s), home video (1980s), and the internet (1990s), influenced the distribution and consumption of films. Film production usually responded with content to fit the new media, and technical innovations (including widescreen (1950s), 3D, and 4D film ) and more spectacular films to keep theatrical screenings attractive. Systems that were cheaper and more easily handled (including 8mm film , video, and smartphone cameras ) allowed for an increasing number of people to create films of varying qualities, for any purpose including home movies and video art . The technical quality was usually lower than professional movies, but improved with digital video and affordable, high-quality digital cameras . Improving over time, digital production methods became more popular during the 1990s, resulting in increasingly realistic visual effects and popular feature-length computer animations ."

Various film genres have emerged during the history of film, and enjoyed variable degrees of success. The use of film as an art form traces its origins to several earlier traditions in the arts such as (oral) storytelling , literature, theatre, opera, and visual arts. Cantastoria and similar ancient traditions combined storytelling with series of images that were shown or indicated one after the other. Predecessors to film that had already used light and shadows to create art before the advent of modern film technology include shadowgraphy , shadow puppetry , camera obscura , and the magic lantern . Shadowgraphy and shadow puppetry represent early examples of the intent to use moving imagery for entertainment and storytelling. [ 1 ] Thought to have originated in the Far East, the art form used shadows cast by hands or objects to assist in the creation of narratives. Shadow puppetry enjoyed popularity for centuries around Asia, notably in Java , and eventually spread to Europe during the Age of Enlightenment . [ 2 ] By the 16th century, entertainers often conjured images of ghostly apparitions, using techniques such as camera obscura and other forms of projection to enhance their performances. [ 3 ] Magic lantern shows developed in the latter half of the 17th century seem to have continued this tradition with images of death, monsters and other scary figures.

These popular shows entertained audiences using mechanical slides, rear projection, mobile projectors, superimposition , dissolves , live actors, smoke (on which projections may have been cast), odors, sounds and even electric shocks. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] While many first magic lantern shows were intended to frighten viewers, advances by projectionists allowed for creative and even educational storytelling that could appeal to wider family audiences. [ 7 ] Newly pioneered techniques such as the use of dissolving views and the chromatrope allowed for smoother transitions between two projected images and aided in providing stronger narratives. [ 8 ] In 1833, scientific study of a stroboscopic illusion in spoked wheels by Joseph Plateau , Michael Faraday and Simon Stampfer led to the invention of the Fantascope, also known as the stroboscopic disk or the phenakistiscope , which was popular in several European countries for a while. Plateau thought it could be further developed for use in phantasmagoria and Stampfer imagined a system for longer scenes with strips on rollers, as well as a transparent version (probably intended for projection). Plateau, Charles Wheatstone , Antoine Claudet and others tried to combine the technique with the stereoscope (introduced in 1838) and photography (introduced in 1839) for a more complete illusion of reality, but for decades such experiments were mostly hindered by the need for long exposure times, with motion blur around objects that moved while the reflected light fell on the photo-sensitive chemicals.

A few people managed to get decent results from stop motion techniques, but these were only very rarely marketed and no form of animated photography had much cultural impact before the advent of chronophotography. Most early photographic sequences, known as chronophotography , were not initially intended to be viewed in motion and were typically presented as a serious, even scientific, method of studying locomotion. The sequences almost exclusively involved humans or animals performing a simple movement in front of the camera. [ 9 ] Starting in 1878 with the publication of The Horse in Motion cabinet cards, photographer Eadweard Muybridge began making hundreds of chronophotographic studies of the motion of animals and humans in real-time. He was soon followed by other chronophotographers like Étienne-Jules Marey , Georges Demenÿ , Albert Londe and Ottomar Anschütz . In 1879, Muybridge started lecturing on animal locomotion and used his Zoopraxiscope to project animations of the contours of his recordings, traced onto glass discs. [ 10 ] In 1887, the German inventor and photographer Ottomar Anschütz started presenting his chronophotographic recordings in motion, using a device he called the Elektrischen Schnellseher (also known as the Electrotachyscope ), which displayed short loops on a small milk glass screen. By 1891, he had started mass production of a more economical, coin-operated peep-box viewing device of the same name that was exhibited at international exhibitions and fairs.

Shifting the focus of the medium from technical and scientific interest in motion to entertainment for the masses, he recorded wrestlers, dancers, acrobats, and scenes of everyday life. Nearly 34,000 people paid to see his shows at the Berlin Exhibition Park in summer 1892. Others saw it in London or at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair . Though little evidence remains for most of these recordings, some scenes probably depicted staged comical sequences. Extant records suggest some of his output directly influenced later works by the Edison Company, such as the 1894 film Fred Ott's Sneeze . [ 11 ] Advances towards motion picture projection technologies were based on the popularity of magic lanterns, chronophotographic demonstrations, and other closely related forms of projected entertainment such as illustrated songs . From October 1892 to March 1900, inventor Émile Reynaud exhibited his Théâtre Optique (\"Optical Theatre\") film system at the Musée Grévin in Paris. Reynaud's device, which projected a series of animated stories such as Pauvre Pierrot and Autour d'une cabine , was displayed to over 500,000 visitors over the course of 12,800 shows. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] On 25, 29 and 30 November 1894, Ottomar Anschütz projected moving images from Electrotachyscope discs on a large screen in the darkened Grand Auditorium of a Post Office Building in Berlin, the first showing of life sized pictures in motion.

[ 15 ] Throughout the late 19th century, several inventors such as Wordsworth Donisthorpe , Louis Le Prince , William Friese-Greene , and the Skladanowsky brothers made pioneering contributions to the development of devices that could capture and display moving images, laying the groundwork for the emergence of cinema as an artistic medium. The scenes in these experiments primarily served to demonstrate the technology itself and were usually filmed with family, friends or passing traffic as the moving subjects. The earliest surviving film, known today as the Roundhay Garden Scene (1888), was captured by Louis Le Prince and briefly depicted members of his family in motion. [ 16 ] In June 1889, American inventor Thomas Edison assigned a lab assistant, William Kennedy Dickson , to help develop a device that could produce visuals to accompany the sounds produced from the phonograph . Building upon previous machines by Muybridge, Marey, Anschütz and others, Dickson and his team created the Kinetoscope peep-box viewer, with celluloid loops containing about half a minute of motion picture entertainment.

[ 18 ] As the initial novelty of the images wore off, the Edison Company was slow to diversify their repertoire of films and waning public interest caused business to slow by Spring 1895. To remedy declining profits, experiments, such as The Dickson Experimental Sound Film , were conducted in an attempt to achieve the device's original goal of providing visual accompaniment for sound recordings. Limitations in syncing the sound to the visuals, however, prevented widespread application. [ 20 ] During that same period, inventors began advancing technologies towards film projection that would eventually overtake Edison's peep-box format. [ 21 ] The Skladanowsky brothers , used their self-made Bioscop to display the first moving picture show to a paying audience on 1 November 1895, in Berlin. But they did not have the quality or financial resources to acquire momentum. Most of these films never passed the experimental stage and their efforts garnered little public attention until after cinema had become successful. In the latter half of 1895, brothers Auguste and Louis Lumière filmed a number of short scenes with their invention, the Cinématographe . On 28 December 1895, the brothers gave their first commercial screening in Paris (though evidence exists of demonstrations of the device to small audiences as early as October 1895).

[ 18 ] Following the first screening, the order and selection of films were changed often. [ 21 ] The Lumière brothers' primary business interests were in selling cameras and film equipment to exhibitors, not the actual production of films. Despite this, filmmakers across the world were inspired by the potential of film as exhibitors brought their shows to new countries. This era of filmmaking, dubbed by film historian Tom Gunning as \"the cinema of attractions\", offered a relatively cheap and simple way of providing entertainment to the masses. Rather than focusing on stories, Gunning argues, filmmakers mainly relied on the ability to delight audiences through the \"illusory power\" of viewing sequences in motion, much as they did in the Kinetoscope era that preceded it. [ 24 ] Despite this, early experimentation with fiction filmmaking (both in actuality film and other genres) did occur. Films were mostly screened inside temporary storefront spaces, in tents of traveling exhibitors at fairs, or as \"dumb\" acts in vaudeville programs. [ 25 ] During this period, before the process of post-production was clearly defined, exhibitors were allowed to exercise their creative freedom in their presentations.

At both the Edison and Lumière studios, loose narratives such as the 1895 Edison film, Washday Troubles, established short relationship dynamics and simple storylines. [ 28 ] In 1896, La Fée aux Choux ( The Fairy of the Cabbages ) was first released. Directed and edited by Alice Guy , the story is arguably the earliest narrative film in history, as well as the first film to be directed by a woman. [ 29 ] That same year, the Edison Manufacturing Company released The May Irwin Kiss in May to widespread financial success. The film, which featured the first kiss in cinematic history, led to the earliest known calls for film censorship . [ 30 ] Another early film producer was Australia's Limelight Department . Commencing in 1898, it was operated by The Salvation Army in Melbourne , Australia. The Limelight Department produced evangelistic material for use by the Salvation Army, including lantern slides as early as 1891, as well as private and government contracts.

In its infancy, film was rarely recognized as an art form by presenters or audiences. Regarded by the upper class as a \"vulgar\" and \"lowbrow\" form of cheap entertainment, films largely appealed to the working class and were often too short to hold any strong narrative potential. [ 31 ] Initial advertisements promoted the technologies used to screen films rather than the films themselves. As the devices became more familiar to audiences, their potential for capturing and recreating events was exploited primarily in the form of newsreels and actualities. [ 32 ] During the creation of these films, cinematographers often drew upon aesthetic values established by past art forms such as framing and the intentional placement of the camera in the composition of their image. [ 33 ] In a 1955 article for The Quarterly of Film Radio and television, film producer and historian Kenneth Macgowan asserted that the intentional staging and recreation of events for newsreels \"brought storytelling to the screen\". [ 34 ] With the advertisement of film technologies over content, actualities initially began as a \"series of views\" that often contained shots of beautiful and lively places or performance acts.

After the cinematographer shot scenes, they often exhibited their recordings locally and then sent them back to the company factory in Lyon to make duplicate prints for sale to whoever wanted them. [ 35 ] In the process of filming actualities, especially those of real events, filmmakers discovered and experimented with multiple camera techniques to accommodate for their unpredictable nature. [ 36 ] Due to the short length (often only one shot) of many actualities, catalogue records indicate that production companies marketed to exhibitors by promoting multiple actualities with related subject matters that could be purchased to complement each other. Exhibitors who bought the films often presented them in a program and would provide spoken accompaniment to explain the action on screen to audiences. [ 33 ] The first paying audience for a motion picture gathered at Madison Square Garden to see a staged actuality that purported itself to be a boxing fight filmed by Woodville Latham using a device called the Eidoloscope on May 20, 1895. Commissioned by Latham, the French inventor Eugene Augustin Lauste created the device with additional expertise from William Kennedy Dickson and crafted a mechanism that came to be known as the Latham loop , which allowed for longer continuous runtimes and was less abrasive on the celluloid film.

F. Percy Smith was an early nature documentary pioneer working for Charles Urban when he pioneered the use of time lapse and micro cinematography in his 1910 documentary on the growth of flowers.

    "text": "The history of theatre charts the development of theatre over the past 2,500 years. While performative elements are present in every society, it is customary to acknowledge a distinction between theatre as an art form and entertainment, and theatrical or performative elements in other activities. The history of theatre is primarily concerned with the origin and subsequent development of the theatre as an autonomous activity. Since classical Athens in the 5th century BC, vibrant traditions of theatre have flourished in cultures across the world. [ 1 ] There is no conclusive evidence that theater evolved from ritual, despite the similarities between the performance of ritual actions and theatre and the significance of this relationship. [ 2 ] This similarity of early theatre to ritual is negatively attested by Aristotle , who in his Poetics defined theatre in contrast to the performances of sacred mysteries : theatre did not require the spectator to fast, drink the kykeon , or march in a procession; however theatre did resemble the sacred mysteries in the sense that it brought purification and healing to the spectator by means of a vision, the theama . The physical location of such performances was accordingly named theatron . [ 3 ] According to the historians Oscar Brockett and Franklin Hildy, rituals typically include elements that entertain or give pleasure, such as costumes and masks as well as skilled performers. As societies grew more complex, these spectacular elements began to be acted out under non-ritualistic conditions. As this occurred, the first steps towards theatre as an autonomous activity were being taken.

Athenian comedy is conventionally divided into three periods, \"Old Comedy\", \"Middle Comedy\", and \"New Comedy\". Old Comedy survives today largely in the form of the eleven surviving plays of Aristophanes , while Middle Comedy is largely lost (preserved only in relatively short fragments in authors such as Athenaeus of Naucratis ). New Comedy is known primarily from the substantial papyrus fragments of plays by Menander . Aristotle defined comedy as a representation of laughable people that involves some kind of error or ugliness that does not cause pain or destruction.

While the majority were employed for dancing and singing, a minority of actresses are known to have performed speaking roles, and there were actresses who achieved wealth, fame and recognition for their art, such as Eucharis , Dionysia , Galeria Copiola and Fabia Arete : they also formed their own acting guild, the Sociae Mimae , which was evidently quite wealthy.

Since the end of the theatre of ancient Rome , which partly coincided with the fall of the Western Roman Empire , mimes and comedies were still performed. Alongside this pagan form of representation, mostly performed by tropes and wandering actors of which there are no direct written sources, the theatre was reborn, in medieval times, from religious functions and from the dramatization of some tropes of which the most famous and ancient is the short Quem quaeritis? from the 10th century, still in Latin . It can therefore be assumed that there were two main lines on which the ancient Italian theatre developed. The first, consisting of the dramatization of Catholic liturgies and of which more documentation is retained, and the second, formed by pagan forms of spectacle such as the staging for city festivals, [ k ] the court preparations of the jesters and the songs of the troubadours .

These dramatizations were included in order to vivify annual celebrations. [ 40 ] Symbolic objects and actions – vestments , altars , censers , and pantomime performed by priests – recalled the events which Christian ritual celebrates. These were extensive sets of visual signs that could be used to communicate with a largely illiterate audience. These performances developed into liturgical dramas , the earliest of which is the Whom do you Seek (Quem-Quaeritis) Easter trope, dating from ca. 925. [ 40 ] Liturgical drama was sung responsively by two groups and did not involve actors impersonating characters. However, sometime between 965 and 975, Æthelwold of Winchester composed the Regularis Concordia (Monastic Agreement) which contains a playlet complete with directions for performance. [ 41 ] Hrosvitha (c. 935 – 973), a canoness in northern Germany , wrote six plays modeled on Terence 's comedies but using religious subjects. These six plays – Abraham, Callimachus, Dulcitius, Gallicanus, Paphnutius, and Sapientia – are the first known plays composed by a female dramatist and the first identifiable Western dramatic works of the post-classical era.

As the Viking invasions ceased in the middle of the 11th century, liturgical drama had spread from Russia to Scandinavia to Italy . Only in Muslim-occupied Iberian Peninsula were liturgical dramas not presented at all. Despite the large number of liturgical dramas that have survived from the period, many churches would have only performed one or two per year and a larger number never performed any at all. [ 42 ] The Feast of Fools was especially important in the development of comedy. The festival inverted the status of the lesser clergy and allowed them to ridicule their superiors and the routine of church life. Sometimes plays were staged as part of the occasion and a certain amount of burlesque and comedy crept into these performances. Although comic episodes had to truly wait until the separation of drama from the liturgy, the Feast of Fools undoubtedly had a profound effect on the development of comedy in both religious and secular plays. [ 43 ] Performance of religious plays outside of the church began sometime in the 12th century through a traditionally accepted process of merging shorter liturgical dramas into longer plays which were then translated into vernacular and performed by laymen.

The importance of the High Middle Ages in the development of theatre was the economic and political changes that led to the formation of guilds and the growth of towns. This would lead to significant changes in the Late Middle Ages . In the British Isles , plays were produced in some 127 different towns during the Middle Ages. These vernacular Mystery plays were written in cycles of a large number of plays: York (48 plays), Chester (24), Wakefield (32) and Unknown (42). A larger number of plays survive from France and Germany in this period and some type of religious dramas were performed in nearly every European country in the Late Middle Ages . Many of these plays contained comedy, devils , villains and clowns .

It is difficult to determine the exact point at which dance became part of human culture . Dance is filled with aesthetic values, making it distinct from one society to another. It is filled with symbolism that expounds on the cultural heritage of a community, each style being unique from one another. Dance can help tell a story, convey feelings and emotions, and connect with others and ourselves. The natural impulse to dance has been found to exist in primates in response to rhythmic beat. [ 1 ] Dance has been an important part of ceremony , rituals , celebrations and entertainment since before the birth of the earliest human civilizations . Archaeology delivers traces of dance from prehistoric times such as the 10,000-year-old Bhimbetka rock shelters paintings in India and Egyptian tomb depicting dancing figures from c. 3300 BC. Many contemporary dance forms can be traced back to historical , traditional , ceremonial and ethnic dances of the ancient period. Dance may have been used as a tool of social interaction that promoted cooperation essential for survival among early humans . Studies found that today's best dancers share two specific genes associated with a predisposition for being good at social communication. [ 2 ] Also, the term \"kinesthetic\" is the right term to help understanding how dance makes communication. \"Kinesthetic\" means recognition of movement of one's own body, and is a combination of two words ( Greek : kinein \"to move\", aesthesis \"perception\").

[ 10 ] According to a Sinhalese legend, Kandyan dances originated 2500 years ago from a magic dance ritual that broke the spell on a bewitched king to cure the king of a mysterious illness. One of the earliest structured uses of dances may have been in the performance and telling of myths. It was also sometimes used to show feelings for one of the opposite gender. It is also linked to the origin of \"lovemaking\". Before the production of written languages, dance was one of the methods of passing these stories down from generation to generation. [ 11 ] In European culture, one of the earliest records of dancing is by Homer , whose Iliad describes chorea (χορεία khoreia ). The early Greeks made the art of dancing into a system, expressive of all the different passions. For example, the dance of the Furies , so represented, would create complete terror among those who witnessed them. The Greek philosopher, Aristotle , ranked dancing with poetry , and said that certain dancers, with rhythm applied to gesture, could express manners, passions, and actions. [ 12 ] The most eminent Greek sculptors studied the attitude of the dancers for their art of imitating the passion. An early manuscript describing dance is the Natya Shastra on which is based the modern interpretation of classical Indian dance (e.g. Bharathanatyam ).

Later, linking dance with immoral trafficking and prostitution, British rule prohibited public performance of dance. Many disapproved of it. In 1947, India won its freedom and created for dance an ambience where it could regain its past glory. Classical forms and regional distinctions were re-discovered, ethnic specialties were honored, and by synthesizing them with the individual talents of the masters in the line and fresh innovations, emerged dance with a new face but with classicism of the past. In Sri Lanka , the ancient Sinhalese chronicle Mahavamsa states that when King Vijaya landed in Sri Lanka in 543 BCE he heard sounds of music and dancing from a wedding ceremony. The origins of the dances of Sri Lanka are dated back to the aboriginal tribes, and to the mythological times of aboriginal yingyang twins and \" yakkas \" (devils). The classical dances of Sri Lanka (Kandyan dances) feature a highly developed system of tala (rhythm) and provided by cymbals called thalampataa. There is a long recorded history of Chinese dances. Some of the dances mentioned in ancient texts, such as dancing with sleeve movements are still performed today. Some of the early dances were associated with shamanic rituals.

However, Chinese opera became popular during the Song and Yuan dynasty, and many dances were merged into Chinese opera. [ 13 ] The art of dance in women also declined from the Song dynasty onward as a result of the increasing popularity of footbinding , [ 14 ] a practice that ironically may have originated from dancing when a dancer wrapped her feet so she may dance ballet-fashion. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] The best-known of the Chinese traditional dances are the dragon dance and lion dance . Lion dance was described in the Tang dynasty in form that resembles today's dance. [ 13 ] The people of the Iranian plateau have known dance in the forms of music, play, drama or religious rituals and have used instruments like mask, costumes of animals or plants, and musical instruments for rhythm, at least since the 6th millennium BC. Cultural mixed forms of dance, play and drama have served rituals like celebration, mourning and worship. And the actors have been masters of music, dance, physical acts and manners of expression.

[ 18 ] This cult later became highly adhered in the Roman Empire . This dance was to promote vigor in life. [ 19 ] Ancient Persian dance was significantly researched by Greek historian from Herodotus of Halikarnassos, in his work Book IX (Calliope) , in which he describes the history of Asian empires and Persian wars until 478 BC.

[ 18 ] As a result, many of the talented Persian dancers moved to the West and spread out mainly in Europe and the United States and a new generation of Iranian dancers and ballet artists have grown up in the Diaspora. [ 18 ] The origins of ballet dancing can be traced to the Italian Renaissance courts of the 15th century. Dance masters would teach the steps to nobility and the court would participate in performances as a form of social entertainment. This practice continued for several centuries. In the 17th century, courtly ballet reached its peak under the rule of King Louis XIV . [ 21 ] By the 18th century, ballet had migrated from the French and Italian royal courts to the Paris Opéra under the careful direction of composer/dancer Jean-Baptiste Lully . Lully sought to develop ballet into more serious art. Under his influence, ballet was turned into a recognized art that was performed by professional dancers rather than courtiers. During the 18th century, ballet transitioned from a courtly dance of moving images as a spectacle to performance art in its own right. Ballet performances developed around a central narrative and contained an expressive movement that revealed the relationships between characters.

The ballet d'action strove to express, for the first time, human emotions drawn directly from the dancers themselves. Masks previously worn by performers were removed so that emotional content could be derived from facial expressions. [ 21 ] Costumes during this time were very restricting for dancers. Although a more expressive use of the body was encouraged, dancers' movements were still restricted due to heavy materials and corseted dresses. Costumes often covered a dancer's physique and made it difficult to see complex or intricate choreography. It was not until choreographer Jean Georges Noverre called for dance reforms in 1760 with his Letters on Dancing and Ballets that costumes became more conducive. Noverre urged that costumes be crafted using lightweight fabrics that move fluidly with the body, complementing a dancer's figure. In addition, dancers wore soft slippers that fit snugly along the foot. This shoe design instilled confidence within the ballerina , daring her to dance on her toes. Naturalistic costuming allowed dancers to push the boundaries of movement, eventually rising en pointe . The era of Romanticism produced ballets inspired by fantasy, mystique, and the unfamiliar cultures of exotic places. Ballets that focused more on the emotions, the fantasy and the spiritual worlds and heralded the beginning of true pointe-work. Now, on her toes, the deified ballerina (embodied in this period by the legendary ballerina Marie Taglioni ) seemed to magically skim the surface of the stage, an ethereal being never quite touching the ground.

It was during this period that the ascending star of the ballerina quite eclipsed the presence of the poor male dancer, who was in many cases reduced to the status of a moving statue, present only in order to lift the ballerina. This sad state was really only redressed by the rise of the male ballet star Vaslav Nijinsky , with the Ballets Russes , in the early 20th century. Ballet as we know it had well and truly evolved by this time, with all the familiar conventions of costume, choreographic form, plot, pomp, and circumstance firmly fixed in place. Nijinsky brought athleticism into ballet. Although at that time his choreography was considered as controversial, now they are considered as one of the first contemporary ballets. [1] Since the Ballets Russes began revolutionizing ballet in the early 20th century, there have been continued attempts to break the mold of classical ballet. Currently the artistic scope of ballet technique (and its accompanying music, jumper, and multimedia ) is more all-encompassing than ever. The boundaries that classify a work of classical ballet are constantly being stretched, muddied and blurred until perhaps all that remains today are traces of technique idioms such as turnout . The 20th century was indeed a period of breaking away from everything that ballet stood for. It was a time of unprecedented creative growth, for dancers and choreographers. It was also a time of the broadening of the definition of dance. Ballets Russes was a turning point to the future of ballet in the West and in the world.

[3] African dance refers mainly to the dance styles of Sub-Saharan Africa , of which many are based on traditional rhythms and music traditions of the region. Modern African dance styles are deeply rooted in culture and tradition. Many tribes have a role solely for the purpose of passing on the tribe's dance traditions; dances which have been passed down through the centuries, often unchanged, with little to no room for improvisation. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] Each tribe developed its own unique style of dance, falling into three categories based on purpose. However, many dances did not have only one purpose. Rather, there was often one primary purpose, that blended into many secondary purposes. Dance was often very important to the maintenance of a ruler's status in the tribal society. Colonialism and globalization have resulted in the eradication of certain styles of African dance. Other styles have been blended together, or mixed with dance styles outside of Africa. [ 22 ] As people were taken from Africa to be sold as slaves, especially starting in the 1500s, they brought their dance styles with them. Entire cultures were imported into the New World, especially those areas where slaves were given more flexibility to continue their cultures and where there were more African slaves than Europeans or indigenous Americans, such as Brazil .

[ 20 ] However, in North America, slaves did not have as much freedom to continue their culture and dance. [ 23 ] [ 20 ] In many cases, these dances have evolved into modern dance styles, such as African-American dance and Brazilian dance . For example, the Calenda evolved in Brazil from tribal dance. The Calenda then evolved into the Cakewalk, which was danced originally to mock plantation owners; it then evolved into the Charleston . [ 20 ] Capoeira was a martial art practiced originally in Africa which the enslaved Africans masked as a form of dance in order to not arouse the suspicion of plantation owners. [ 24 ] After the explosion of modern dance in the early 20th century, the 1960s saw the growth of postmodernism . Postmodernism veered towards simplicity, the beauty of small things, the beauty of untrained body, and unsophisticated movement. The famous \"No\" manifesto , by Yvonne Rainer , rejecting all costumes, stories and outer trappings in favour of raw and unpolished movement was perhaps the extreme of this wave of thinking.

Hip-hop dance started when Clive Campbell, aka Kool DJ Herc and the father of hip-hop, came to New York from Jamaica in 1967. Toting the seeds of reggae from his homeland, he is credited with being the first DJ to use two turntables and identical copies of the same record to create his jams. But it was his extension of the breaks in these songs—the musical section where the percussive beats were most aggressive—that allowed him to create and name a culture of break boys and break girls who laid it down when the breaks came up. Briefly termed b-boys and b-girls, these dancers founded breakdancing , which is now a cornerstone of hip-hop dance."

The beginnings of all these traditions is thought to be humans satisfying the very basic need of shelter and protection. [ 1 ] The term \"architecture\" generally refers to buildings, but in its essence is much broader, including fields we now consider specialized forms of practice, such as urbanism , civil engineering , naval , military , [ 2 ] and landscape architecture . Trends in architecture were influenced, among other factors, by technological innovations, particularly in the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries. The improvement and/or use of steel , cast iron , tile, reinforced concrete , and glass helped for example Art Nouveau appear and made Beaux Arts more grandiose. [ 3 ] Humans and their ancestors have been creating various types of shelters for at least hundreds of thousands of years, and shelter-building may have been present early in hominin evolution. All great apes will construct \"nests\" for sleeping , albeit at different frequencies and degrees of complexity. Chimpanzees regularly make nests out of bundles of branches woven together; [ 4 ] these vary depending on the weather (nests have thicker bedding when cool and are built with larger, stronger supports in windy or wet weather). [ 5 ] Orangutans currently make the most complex nests out of all non-human great apes, complete with roofs, blankets, pillows, and \"bunks\".

[ 7 ] Retaining arboreal features like highly prehensile hands for the expert construction of nests and shelters would have also benefitted early hominins in unpredictable environments and changing climates. [ 5 ] Many hominins, especially the earliest ones such as Ardipithecus [ 8 ] and Australopithecus [ 9 ] retained such features and may have chosen to build nests in trees where available. The development of a \"home base\" 2 million years ago may have also fostered the evolution of constructing shelters or protected caches. [ 10 ] Regardless of the complexity of nest-building, early hominins may still have still slept in more or less 'open' conditions, unless the opportunity of a rock shelter was afforded. [ 7 ] These rock shelters could be used as-is with little more amendments than nests and hearths, or in the case of established bases —especially among later hominins— they could be personalized with rock art (in the case of Lascaux ) or other types of aesthetic structures (in the case of the Bruniquel Cave among the Neanderthals) [ 11 ] In cases of sleeping in open ground, Dutch ethologist Adriaan Kortlandt once proposed that hominins could have built temporary enclosures of thorny bushes to deter predators, which he supported using tests that showed lions becoming averse to food if near thorny branches.

[ 14 ] Due to the perishable nature of shelters of this time, it is difficult to find evidence for dwellings beyond hearths and the stones that may make up a dwelling's foundation. Near Wadi Halfa , Sudan , the Arkin 8 site contains 100,000 year old circles of sandstone that were likely the anchor stones for tents.

[ 17 ] Architectural advances are an important part of the Neolithic period (10,000-2000 BC), during which some of the major innovations of human history occurred. The domestication of plants and animals, for example, led to both new economics and a new relationship between people and the world, an increase in community size and permanence, a massive development of material culture and new social and ritual solutions to enable people to live together in these communities. New styles of individual structures and their combination into settlements provided the buildings required for the new lifestyle and economy, and were also an essential element of change. [ 21 ] Although many dwellings belonging to all prehistoric periods and also some clay models of dwellings have been uncovered enabling the creation of faithful reconstructions, they seldom included elements that may relate them to art. Some exceptions are provided by wall decorations and by finds that equally apply to Neolithic and Chalcolithic rites and art. In South and Southwest Asia, Neolithic cultures appear soon after 10,000 BC, initially in the Levant ( Pre-Pottery Neolithic A and Pre-Pottery Neolithic B ) and from there spread eastwards and westwards. There are early Neolithic cultures in Southeast Anatolia, Syria and Iraq by 8000 BC, and food-producing societies first appear in southeast Europe by 7000 BC, and Central Europe by c. 5500 BC (of which the earliest cultural complexes include the Starčevo-Koros (Cris) , Linearbandkeramic ,"

Mesopotamia is most noted for its construction of mud-brick buildings and the construction of ziggurats , occupying a prominent place in each city and consisting of an artificial mound, often rising in huge steps, surmounted by a temple. The mound was no doubt to elevate the temple to a commanding position in what was otherwise a flat river valley. The great city of Uruk had a number of religious precincts, containing many temples larger and more ambitious than any buildings previously known. [ 33 ] The word ziggurat is an anglicized form of the Akkadian word ziqqurratum , the name given to the solid stepped towers of mud brick. It derives from the verb zaqaru , (\"to be high\"). The buildings are described as being like mountains linking Earth and heaven.

[ 34 ] Modern imaginings of ancient Egypt are heavily influenced by the surviving traces of monumental architecture. Many formal styles and motifs were established at the dawn of the pharaonic state, around 3100 BC. The most iconic Ancient Egyptian buildings are the pyramids , built during the Old and Middle Kingdoms ( c. 2600–1800 BC) as tombs for the pharaoh . However, there are also impressive temples, like the Karnak Temple Complex . The Ancient Egyptians believed in the afterlife . They also believed that in order for their soul (known as ka ) to live eternally in their afterlife, their bodies would have to remain intact for eternity. So, they had to create a way to protect the deceased from damage and grave robbers. This way, the mastaba was born. These were adobe structures with flat roofs, which had underground rooms for the coffin, about 30 m down. Imhotep , an ancient Egyptian priest and architect, had to design a tomb for the Pharaoh Djoser . For this, he placed five mastabas, one above the next, this way creating the first Egyptian pyramid, the Pyramid of Djoser at Saqqara ( c. 2667–2648 BC), which is a step pyramid . The first smooth-sided one was built by Pharaoh Sneferu , who ruled between c. 2613 and 2589 BC. The most imposing one is the Great Pyramid of Giza , made for Sneferu's son: Khufu ( c. 2589–2566"

The most imposing one is the Great Pyramid of Giza , made for Sneferu's son: Khufu ( c. 2589–2566 BC), being the last surviving wonder of the ancient world and the largest pyramid in Egypt. The stone blocks used for pyramids were held together by mortar , and the entire structure was covered with highly polished white limestone, with their tops topped in gold. What we see today is actually the core structure of the pyramid. Inside, narrow passages led to the royal burial chambers. Despite being highly associated with the Ancient Egypt, pyramids have been built by other civilisations too, like the Mayans . Due to the lack of resources and a shift in power towards priesthood, ancient Egyptians stepped away from pyramids, and temples became the focal point of cult construction. Just like the pyramids, Ancient Egyptian temples were also spectacular and monumental. They evolved from small shrines made of perishable materials to large complexes, and by the New Kingdom (circa 1550–1070 BC) they have become massive stone structures consisting of halls and courtyards. The temple represented a sort of 'cosmos' in stone, a copy of the original mound of creation on which the god could rejuvenate himself and the world. The entrance consisted of a twin gateway ( pylon ), symbolizing the hills of the horizon. Inside there were columned halls symbolizing a primeval papyrus thicket. It was followed by a series of hallways of decreasing size, until the sanctuary was reached, where a god's cult statue was placed. Back in ancient times, temples were painted in bright colours, mainly red, blue, yellow, green, orange, and"

It was followed by a series of hallways of decreasing size, until the sanctuary was reached, where a god's cult statue was placed. Back in ancient times, temples were painted in bright colours, mainly red, blue, yellow, green, orange, and white. Because of the desert climate of Egypt, some parts of these painted surfaces were preserved well, especially in interiors. An architectural element specific to ancient Egyptian architecture is the cavetto cornice (a concave moulding ), introduced by the end of the Old Kingdom. It was widely used to accentuate the top of almost every formal pharaonic building. Because of how often it was used, it will later decorate many Egyptian Revival buildings and objects. [ 42 ] [ 39 ] The first Urban Civilization in the Indian subcontinent is traceable originally to the Indus Valley civilisation mainly in Mohenjodaro and Harappa , now in modern-day Pakistan as well western states of the Republic of India. The earliest settlements are seen during the Neolithic period in Merhgarh , Balochistan . The civilization's cities were noted for their urban planning with baked brick buildings, elaborate drainage and water systems, and handicraft ( carnelian products, seal carving). This civilisation transitioned from the Neolithic period into the Chalcolithic period and beyond with their expertise in metallurgy (copper, bronze, lead, and tin). [ 45 ] Their urban centres possibly grew to contain between 30,000 and 60,000 individuals, [ 46 ] and the civilisation itself may have contained between one and five million individuals.

[ 47 ] Since the advent of the Classical Age in Athens , in the 5th century BC, the Classical way of building has been deeply woven into Western understanding of architecture and, indeed, of civilization itself. [ 54 ] From circa 850 BC to circa 300 AD, ancient Greek culture flourished on the Greek mainland , on the Peloponnese , and on the Aegean islands. However, Ancient Greek architecture is best known for its temples , many of which are found throughout the region, and the Parthenon is a prime example of this. Later, they will serve as inspiration for Neoclassical architects during the late 18th and the 19th century. The most well-known temples are the Parthenon and the Erechtheion , both on the Acropolis of Athens . Another type of important Ancient Greek buildings were the theatres. Both temples and theatres used a complex mix of optical illusions and balanced ratios. Ancient Greek temples usually consist of a base with continuous stairs of a few steps at each edges (known as crepidoma ), a cella (or naos ) with a cult statue in it, columns , an entablature, and two pediments , one on the front side and another in the back. By the 4th century BC, Greek architects and stonemasons had developed a system of rules for all buildings known as the orders : the Doric , the Ionic , and the Corinthian. They are most easily recognised by their columns (especially by the capitals ). The Doric column is stout and basic, the Ionic one is slimmer and has four scrolls (called volutes ) at the corners of the capital, and the Corinthian column is just like the Ionic one, but the capital is completely different, being"

The Doric column is stout and basic, the Ionic one is slimmer and has four scrolls (called volutes ) at the corners of the capital, and the Corinthian column is just like the Ionic one, but the capital is completely different, being decorated with acanthus leaves and four scrolls. [ 48 ] Besides columns, the frieze was different based on order. While the Doric one has metopes and triglyphs with guttae , Ionic and Corinthian friezes consist of one big continuous band with reliefs . Besides the columns, the temples were highly decorated with sculptures, in the pediments, on the friezes , metopes and triglyphs . Ornaments used by Ancient Greek architects and artists include palmettes , vegetal or wave -like scrolls , lion mascarons (mostly on lateral cornices ), dentils , acanthus leaves, bucrania , festoons , egg-and-dart , rais-de-cœur , beads, meanders , and acroteria at the corners of the pediments. Pretty often, ancient Greek ornaments are used continuously, as bands. They will later be used in Etruscan , Roman and in the post-medieval styles that tried to revive Greco-Roman art and architecture, like Renaissance , Baroque , Neoclassical etc. Looking at the archaeological remains of ancient and medieval buildings it is easy to perceive them as limestone and concrete in a grey taupe tone and make the assumption that ancient buildings were monochromatic. However, architecture was polychromed in much of the Ancient and Medieval world. One of the most iconic Ancient buildings, the Parthenon ( c. 447–432 BC) in Athens , had details painted with vibrant reds, blues and greens. Besides ancient temples, Medieval cathedrals were never completely white. Most had colored highlights on capitals and columns . [ 55 ] This practice of coloring buildings and artworks was"

Besides ancient temples, Medieval cathedrals were never completely white. Most had colored highlights on capitals and columns . [ 55 ] This practice of coloring buildings and artworks was abandoned during the early Renaissance. This is because Leonardo da Vinci and other Renaissance artists, including Michelangelo , promoted a color palette inspired by the ancient Greco-Roman ruins, which because of neglect and constant decay during the Middle Ages, became white despite being initially colorful. The pigments used in the ancient world were delicate and especially susceptible to weathering. Without necessary care, the colors exposed to rain, snow, dirt, and other factors, vanished over time, and this way Ancient buildings and artworks became white, like they are today and were during the Renaissance. [ 56 ] Celtic architecture, in its broadest sense, refers to the styles and structures associated with the Celtic peoples who once inhabited a large part of Europe, including parts of modern-day France, Germany, the British Isles, and beyond. [ 60 ] This architecture is difficult to define strictly because the Celts did not have a unified, standardized architectural style across the different regions they inhabited. However, general characteristics of Celtic architecture are shared, for example, in structures of central Europe like from Germany and France, which provide insights into the material culture and architectural forms of the Celts in these regions. Many Celtic structures, particularly in the earlier periods, were made of wood, which has not survived as well as stone or other materials. [ 61 ] The Celts often built round houses and settlements, with circular huts (or roundhouses) being the most common residential structures. [ 62 ] The Celts were skilled in creating defensive"

[ 62 ] The Celts were skilled in creating defensive structures, such as hillforts, which included ditches, ramparts, and palisades. [ 63 ] In later periods, especially during the Iron Age, some Celtic groups began constructing stone buildings, such as temples, shrines, and more permanent dwellings. [ 64 ] One of the most famous Celtic sites is the Heuneburg , [ 65 ] located on the Swabian Jura in Germany. Heuneburg was a large Celtic settlement and a key center of power in the late Hallstatt and early La Tène periods. The site is famous for its fortifications, including large earthworks and timber palisades, indicative of the Celtic emphasis on defensive architecture. The Mont Lassois is another important Celtic archaeological site [ 66 ] located in the Burgundy region of eastern France, near the town of Montbard, in the Côte-d'Or department. The site is notable for being one of the largest and most significant Celtic oppida (fortified settlements) of the La Tène period (approximately 450 BCE to 1 BCE). Mont Lassois offers crucial insights into Celtic urban planning, architecture, and the socio-political organization of the Celtic tribes in Gaul just before the Roman conquest. The Glauberg Celtic hillfort [ 67 ] or oppidum in Hesse , Germany, is consisting of a fortified settlement and several burial mounds, \"a princely seat of the late Hallstatt and early La Tène periods.\" [ 68 ] [ 69 ] Archaeological discoveries in the 1990s place the site among the most important early Celtic centres in Europe.

[ 70 ] The Nabataeans , an ancient Arab people, had an architectural style that is notable for its rock-cut temples and tombs, most famously the ones found in Petra , Jordan. [ 71 ] Another partially preserved site is found at Hegra (Mada’in Salih) , Saudi Arabia. Most architectural Nabatean remains, dating from the 1st century BC to the 2nd century AD, are highly visible and well-preserved, with over 500 monuments in Petra, in modern-day Jordan, and 110 well preserved tombs set in the desert landscape of Hegra . [ citation needed ] The architecture of ancient Rome has been one of the most influential in the world. Its legacy is evident throughout the medieval and early modern periods, and Roman buildings continue to be reused in the modern era in both New Classical and Postmodern architecture. It was particularly influenced by Greek and Etruscan styles. A range of temple types was developed during the republican years (509–27 BC), modified from Greek and Etruscan prototypes. Wherever the Roman army conquered, they established towns and cities, spreading their empire and advancing their architectural and engineering achievements. While the most important works are to be found in Italy, Roman builders also found creative outlets in the western and eastern provinces, of which the best examples preserved are in modern-day North Africa , Turkey , Syria and Jordan .
